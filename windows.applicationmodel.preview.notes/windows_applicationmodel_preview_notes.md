# Windows.ApplicationModel.Preview.Notes

## -description
Enables a note-taking app to implement a number of features for a faster and more effective note-taking experience in certain situations (see Remarks).

## -remarks
The **Preview Notes** feature allows a Universal Windows app to utilize the **Windows Ink Workspace** in order to provide a tailored note-taking experience on desktop devices. Apps that are recognized as such will operate with a number of behavioral changes meant to make the note-taking process faster and more convenient. For example, note-taking apps will open without a splash screen, will appear in the "Sticky Notes" section of the **Windows Ink Workspace**, will have their own configurable view-switching mechanism, and can display notes on a locked screen.

## -description
**Deprecated.** Occurs when a menu is closed.

## -remarks
Use of the *Command Bar* (also known as "App Bar") UX element is deprecated for UWP apps using JavaScript and no longer supported.
If your app still requires it, this functionality is available from the [WinJS 4](https://try.buildwinjs.com/download/GetWinJS/) library.

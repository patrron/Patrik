# Windows.Graphics.Display.BrightnessOverride.StartOverride

## -description
Request to start overriding the screen brightness level. The request to start overriding does not mean that the screen brightness level always changes to match the specified override brightness level. It's still up to the system to decide whether or not to honor this override request. Use [IsOverrideActive](brightnessoverride_isoverrideactive.md) and [IsOverrideActiveChanged](brightnessoverride_isoverrideactivechanged.md) properties to determine if the system has honored the override request.

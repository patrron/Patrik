# Windows.Gaming.Input.ForceFeedback.ConditionForceEffect

## -description
Conditional force effects are forces applied in response to current sensor values within the device. In other words, conditional force effects require information about device motion, such as position or velocity of a joystick handle. In general, conditional force effects are not associated with individual events during a game or other application. They represent ambient phenomena, such as the stiffness or looseness of a flight stick, or the tendency of a steering wheel to return to a straight-ahead position. A conditional force effect does not have a predefined magnitude. The magnitude is scaled in proportion to the movement or position of the input object.

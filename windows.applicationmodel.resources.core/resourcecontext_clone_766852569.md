# Windows.ApplicationModel.Resources.Core.ResourceContext.Clone

## -description
Creates a clone of this [ResourceContext](resourcecontext.md), with identical qualifiers.

## -returns
A new, cloned [ResourceContext](resourcecontext.md).

## -remarks
By default, a cloned context has the same qualifier values as the default context from which it was derived. If a qualifier value in the default context changes, the changes are reflected in the cloned context as well. However, if a qualifier value is programmatically overridden on the cloned context, the linkage to the default context for that qualifier is removedâ€” changes to that qualifier value in the cloned context do not affect the default context, and vice versa. This linkage can be restored using the [Reset](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.resources.core.resourcecontext.reset) method.

# Windows.UI.Xaml.Input.ManipulationStartedRoutedEventArgs.Handled

## -description
Gets or sets a value that marks the routed event as handled. Setting to **true** prevents most handlers along the event route from handling the same event again.

## -property-value
**true** to mark the routed event handled; **false** to leave the routed event unhandled, which permits the event to potentially route further. The default is **false**.

# Windows.Security.Credentials.UI

## -description

Enables you to use credentials without the complexity of the underlying operations, providing a uniform experience for credentials that reduces credential prompting to an absolute minimum. This namespace collects various types of credentials from users, stores them on the local computer, and presents them to web services and proxies by using existing authentication models.

## -remarks

Enterprise credentials retrieved from the [CredentialPicker](credentialpicker.md) don't have the capability to roam.

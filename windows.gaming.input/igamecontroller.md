# Windows.Gaming.Input.IGameController

## -description
The core interface required to be implemented by all controller devices, regardless of their actual type (gamepad, racing wheel, flight stick, and so on). This interface exists mainly to support extensibility for game controllers, which allows OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) to publish WinRT (Windows Runtime) classes that provide rich access to their device's features, while integrating into the underlying game controller device enumeration framework.

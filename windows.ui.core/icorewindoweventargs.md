# Windows.UI.Core.ICoreWindowEventArgs

## -description
Defines the set of arguments returned to an app after a window input or behavior event.

## -remarks
This interface is passed to the app in the corresponding event delegate. The app can use this to set the [Handled](icorewindoweventargs_handled.md) property, which, when true, informs the framework to perform default processing of the event.

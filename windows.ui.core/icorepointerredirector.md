# Windows.UI.Core.ICorePointerRedirector

## -description
Defines pointer events for cross-process input handling.

An implementation of the ICorePointerRedirector interface is provided by the [CoreWindow](corewindow.md) class.

Input chaining refers to the interaction behavior of both a parent object (host) and a nested child object (component) when an input boundary is reached.

In a single process, chaining embedded (or nested) content is managed by the system (through [Direct Manipulation](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/directmanipulation/direct-manipulation-portal)).

For cross-process chaining, the pointer events defined in this interface provide input routing details.

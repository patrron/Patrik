## -enum-fields
### -field ProcessOneAndAllPending:0
Dispatch all currently available events in the queue. If no events are pending, wait for the next new event.

### -field ProcessOneIfPresent:1
Dispatch one event if it is currently pending in the queue. If no events are pending, do not wait for a new event to be raised but instead return immediately.

### -field ProcessUntilQuit:2
Wait for new events and dispatch all available events. Continue this behavior until the window is closed or the application calls the [Close](corewindow_close_811482585.md) method on the [CoreWindow](corewindow.md) instance.

### -field ProcessAllIfPresent:3
Dispatch all events currently pending in the queue. If no events are pending, do not wait for a new event to be raised but instead return immediately.

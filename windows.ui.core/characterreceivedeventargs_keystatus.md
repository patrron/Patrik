## -remarks
> **WindowsÂ 10**
> Apps do not receive this event when an [Input Method Editor (IME)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5fcc73e6-f499-47e6-8e81-0014ca4d241c) is enabled. The Input Method Editor (IME) handles all keyboard input and sets [Handled](characterreceivedeventargs_handled.md) to **true**.

> **Windows Phone**
> This API is supported in native apps only.

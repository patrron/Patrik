# Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow.CharacterReceived

## -description
Is fired when a new character is received by the input queue.

## -remarks
Apps do not receive this event when an [Input Method Editor (IME)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh967427(v=win.10)) is enabled. The Input Method Editor (IME) handles all keyboard input and sets [Handled](characterreceivedeventargs_handled.md) to **true**.

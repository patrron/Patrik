# Windows.AI.MachineLearning.TensorDouble.CreateFromBuffer

## -description
Creates a double tensor object with the given *shape* and uses the underlying buffer in *data* for subsequent evaluation.

## -parameters
### -param shape
The size of the buffer.

### -param buffer
The buffer to use during evaluation.

## -returns
A double tensor object backed by a buffer reference to the provided [IBuffer](..\windows.storage.streams\ibuffer.md) *data*.

## -remarks
No copies are performed during the creation of this object and the underlying buffer in *data* is used directly by the engine.

Copies to video memory are made when running on non-CPU devices.

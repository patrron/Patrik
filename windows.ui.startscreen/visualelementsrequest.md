# Windows.UI.StartScreen.VisualElementsRequest

## -description
Provides a method to delay the display of the **Pin to Start**  flyout, as well as methods through which you can set the visual elements of the secondary tile to be presented in that flyout as well as alternate versions of the tile that can also be presented as options.

> On Windows Phone 8.1, the secondary tile is created without showing the user a flyout, prompting them for confirmation, or allowing them to choose an alternate version of the tile.

## -remarks
This object is obtained by calling the [Request](visualelementsrequestedeventargs_request.md) method of the [VisualElementsRequestedEventArgs](visualelementsrequestedeventargs.md) object obtained through the [VisualElementsRequested](secondarytile_visualelementsrequested.md) event.

## -returns

## -remarks

## -examples
The following example demonstrates how to delete (unpin) a secondary tile. Note that this example assumes that the tile exists. To determine whether the tile is pinned before you call RequestDeleteAsync, see the [Exists](secondarytile_exists_1536819090.md) method.

```javascript

// Specify the tile to be deleted, using the ID that it was given when it was originally created.
var tileToBeDeleted = new Windows.UI.StartScreen.SecondaryTile("SecondaryTile.01");

// Make the delete request.
tileToBeDeleted.requestDeleteAsync().then(function (isDeleted) {
    if (isDeleted) {
        // Secondary tile successfully deleted.
    } else {
        // Secondary tile not deleted.
    }
});
```

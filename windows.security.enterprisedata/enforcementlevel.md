## -enum-fields
### -field NoProtection:0
The policy calls for no protection. Your app should disable WIP behavior if data is protected, and unprotect data.

In response to an attempted action such as pasting data into an unauthorized app, your app should prompt the user via an overridable warning message. If the user overrides, then your app should perform the action and audit it.

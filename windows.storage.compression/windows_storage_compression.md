# Windows.Storage.Compression

## -description

Provides a unified interface to the compression features included in Windows that frees developers from responsibility for managing block sizes, compression parameters, and other details that the native compression API requires.

You can download a JavaScript sample that reads data from a file and writes compressed data to a new file and reads compressed data and writes decompressed data to a new file. To download this sample, see [Compression sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=258444).

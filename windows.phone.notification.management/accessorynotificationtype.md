# AccessoryNotificationType

## -description
Represents the types of notifications that are raised on the phone. The [IAccessoryNotificationTriggerDetails](iaccessorynotificationtriggerdetails.md) are available to the **IBackgroundTask.Run** method which is executed upon triggering by the [AccessoryManager](accessorymanager.md). Inside the [IAccessoryNotificationTriggerDetails](iaccessorynotificationtriggerdetails.md) is an **INotification** object. The **BackgroundTask** developer needs to investigate this interface to determine what the specific notification type is. [IAccessoryNotificationTriggerDetails.AccessoryNotificationType](iaccessorynotificationtriggerdetails_accessorynotificationtype.md) contains a value from a AccessoryNotificationType enumeration, listed below.

With knowledge of the type of notification, the **BackgroundTask** developer can use the more specific interfaces to gather information about the notification. The values are bit flags. You can OR the enum values together to indicate which notification types to be alerted for.

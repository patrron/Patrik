## -description
Gets a dictionary containing the name and id of the toast capable apps on the device.

+ Offer the user an option to refresh and discover more applications that may be available.
+ Automatically present additional apps as they become available.
+ Show a wait indicator and call GetApps periodically until all apps are finished updating.
+ Cache the app list and use the last known name until the update is completed.


Calling this API requires that the **ID_CAP_SMS** and **ID_CAP_SMS_COMPANION** capabilities be specified in the application manifest.

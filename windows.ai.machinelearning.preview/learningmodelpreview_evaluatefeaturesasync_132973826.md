# Windows.AI.MachineLearning.Preview.LearningModelPreview.EvaluateFeaturesAsync

## -description
Asynchronously evaluates names variable instances as the inputs and outputs for the model.

## -parameters
### -param features
The features to bind as inputs.

### -param correlationId
The value to correlate the evaluation with the output results.

## -returns
The evaluation result.

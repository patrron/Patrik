# Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geolocator.ReportInterval

## -description
The requested minimum time interval between location updates, in milliseconds. If your application requires updates infrequently, set this value so that location services can conserve power by calculating location only when needed.

## -property-value
The requested minimum time interval between location updates.

## -remarks
The default report interval is 1 second or as frequent as the hardware can support â€“ whichever is shorter. Location updates can be set to a different frequency if you specify a [MovementThreshold](geolocator_movementthreshold.md) or set ReportInterval to a different value. If your app sets both [MovementThreshold](geolocator_movementthreshold.md) and ReportInterval, location will be updated according to [MovementThreshold](geolocator_movementthreshold.md).

If another application has requested more frequent updates, by specifying a smaller value for ReportInterval, your application may receive updates at a higher frequency than requested.

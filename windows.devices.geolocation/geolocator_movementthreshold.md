# Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geolocator.MovementThreshold

## -description
The distance of movement, in meters, relative to the coordinate from the last [PositionChanged](geolocator_positionchanged.md) event, that is required for the [Geolocator](geolocator.md) to raise a [PositionChanged](geolocator_positionchanged.md) event.

## -property-value
The distance of required movement, in meters, for location services to raise a [PositionChanged](geolocator_positionchanged.md) event. The default value is 0.

## -remarks
The default report interval is 1 second or as frequent as the hardware can support â€“ whichever is shorter. Location updates can be set to a different frequency if you specify a MovementThreshold or set [ReportInterval](geolocator_reportinterval.md) to a different value. If your app sets both MovementThreshold and [ReportInterval](geolocator_reportinterval.md), location will be updated according to MovementThreshold.

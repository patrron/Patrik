Gets the user that the app was activated for.

## -property-value
The user that the app was activated for.

## -remarks
This property returns the logged-in user on platforms that only support single-user sessions. For platforms that support multiple users in a session (such as Xbox) this property returns the logged-in user that the app was activated for.

This property returns **null** when a multi-user application is activated with no specific user context.

Multi-user apps can use this property to allow or restrict app behavior. For example, you might restrict access to content or features based on the userâ€™s credentials.

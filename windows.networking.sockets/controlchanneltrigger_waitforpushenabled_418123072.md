# Windows.Networking.Sockets.ControlChannelTrigger.WaitForPushEnabled

## -description
Allows an app to notify the system that a connection has been established and the system should complete the internal configuration of the control channel trigger. 

> [!NOTE]
> The ControlChannelTrigger class is not supported on Windows Phone.

## -returns
A value that indicates if the system was able to complete configuration of a [ControlChannelTrigger](controlchanneltrigger.md) object.

## -remarks
Once an app is connected, it must call the WaitForPushEnabled method in order to enable the system to complete the internal configuration of the control channel trigger. If an app tries to use the network trigger mechanism without calling the WaitForPushEnabled method, it will get an exception.

This call to the WaitForPushEnabled method is to be made only after the transport connection is established.

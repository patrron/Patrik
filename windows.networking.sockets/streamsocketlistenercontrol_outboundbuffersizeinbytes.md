# Windows.Networking.Sockets.StreamSocketListenerControl.OutboundBufferSizeInBytes

## -description
The size, in bytes, of the send buffer to be used for sending data on a [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) object created when a connection is received by the [StreamSocketListener](streamsocketlistener.md) object.

## -property-value
The size, in bytes, of the send buffer to be used for sending data on the [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) object created.

## -remarks
The OutboundBufferSizeInBytes property sets the value of the **SO_SNDBUF** socket option on the TCP socket used by the [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) created. The default value is the local computer's default send buffer size. This value varies based on the system memory size. For more detailed information, see [SOL_SOCKET Socket Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/sol-socket-socket-options) in the Windows Sockets documentation.

For most apps, this property should not be set since this disables TCP send auto-tuning by the system on this [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) object. With TCP send auto-tuning disabled, network throughput is often worse especially on a connections with high latency. So this property should only be used in very specific situations.

This property may be set before the [StreamSocketListener](streamsocketlistener.md) starts listening for incoming connections. After the [StreamSocketListener](streamsocketlistener.md) starts listening for incoming connections, setting the property will result in an error.

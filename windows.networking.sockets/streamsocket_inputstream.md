# Windows.Networking.Sockets.StreamSocket.InputStream

## -description
Gets the input stream to read from the remote destination on a [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) object.

## -property-value
A sequential stream of bytes to be read from the remote destination.

## -remarks
This property can be used to read incoming data received from the remote network destination on a socket object. Incoming data can be read using the [IInputStream.ReadAsync](../windows.storage.streams/iinputstream_readasync_1012630619.md) method directly or by passing the [IInputStream](../windows.storage.streams/iinputstream.md) object to other objects ([DataReader](../windows.storage.streams/datareader.md), for example) that accept an [IInputStream](../windows.storage.streams/iinputstream.md) as a parameter.

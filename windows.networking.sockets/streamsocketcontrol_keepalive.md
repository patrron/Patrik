# Windows.Networking.Sockets.StreamSocketControl.KeepAlive

## -description
A value that indicates whether keep-alive packets are sent to the remote destination on a [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) object.

## -property-value
Whether keep-alive packets are sent to the remote destination.

## -remarks
When this property is **true**, the [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) sends keep-alive packets when no data or acknowledgment packets have been received for the TCP connection within an interval. When a [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) is created, the default value for this property is **false**.

This property may be set before the [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) is connected. After the [StreamSocket](streamsocket.md) is connected, setting the property will result in an error.

For more detailed information, see the [SO_KEEPALIVE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/so-keepalive) socket option in the Windows Sockets documentation.

# Windows.Devices.Enumeration.DeviceWatcher.Stop

## -description
Stop raising the events that add, update and remove enumeration results.

## -remarks
To stop a search for devices, an app calls Stop and enters the **Stopping** state. The [Stopped](devicewatcher_stopped.md) event is raised when the Stop operation completes and the [DeviceWatcher](devicewatcher.md) enters the **Stopped** state.

The following diagram shows how the [DeviceWatcher](devicewatcher.md) transitions between the states represented by [DeviceWatcherStatus](devicewatcherstatus.md) enumeration.

This call transitions the [DeviceWatcher](devicewatcher.md) to the **Stopping** state and completes immediately. The watcher will transition to the **Stopped** state once all events that are already in the process of being raised have completed.

Callers may wait for the [Stopped](devicewatcher_stopped.md) event if they need to know when the [DeviceWatcher](devicewatcher.md) has stopped. Callers must wait for the [Stopped](devicewatcher_stopped.md) event before they can call [Start](devicewatcher_start_1587696324.md) to restart the watcher. Callers may unsubscribe from events if they do not want to receive any additional events after Stop but do not want to wait for the [Stopped](devicewatcher_stopped.md) event.

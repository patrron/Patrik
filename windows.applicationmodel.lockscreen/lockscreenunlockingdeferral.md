# Windows.ApplicationModel.LockScreen.LockScreenUnlockingDeferral

## -description
Represents an unlock deferral.
To show an unlock animation, your lock screen app must:

+ Register to be notified of unlocking via the [Unlocking](lockapplicationhost_unlocking.md) event.
+ In the Unlocking event handler, call [GetDeferral](lockscreenunlockingeventargs_getdeferral_254836512.md).
+ Kick off an animation.+ When that animation completes, call [Complete](lockscreenunlockingdeferral_complete_1807836922.md) on the deferral to end the deferral.
+ Note: If the animation takes too long, your lock screen app will be terminated by the system and potentially removed as the userâ€™s default lock app.

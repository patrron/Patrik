# Windows.UI.Input.GestureRecognizer.ManipulationExact

## -description
Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the exact distance from initial contact to end of the interaction is reported.By default, a small distance threshold is subtracted from the first delta reported by the system. This distance threshold is intended to account for slight movements of the contact when processing a tap gesture. If this flag is set, the distance threshold is not subtracted from the first delta.

## -property-value
True if the distance threshold is subtracted; otherwise false. The default value is false.

# Windows.UI.Input.EdgeGesture.Starting

## -description
Fires when a user begins an action to summon or dismiss edge-based UI.

## -remarks
This event occurs only with a touch interaction. A keyboard invocation of edge-based UI does not include this event. The Starting event is always followed by either a [Completed](edgegesture_completed.md) or a [Canceled](edgegesture_canceled.md) event.

When the handler for this event is called, an app could be called to do one of two things, barring a cancellation of the operation: show its edge-based UI if that UI isn't currently shown or hide the UI if it is shown.

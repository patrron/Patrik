# Windows.ApplicationModel.UserActivities.Core

## -description
Manages the creation and deletion of user activities. A **UserActivity** encapsulates a user's task that can be continued at a later time, and potentially on a different device.
For example, a mail app could create a **UserActivity** when the user starts creating a new email message. The user could pause working on the email and then work on it later on the same machine, or even another device.

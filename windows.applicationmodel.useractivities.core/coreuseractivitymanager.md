# Windows.ApplicationModel.UserActivities.Core.CoreUserActivityManager

## -description
Manages the creation and deletion of user activities.

## -remarks
A [UserActivity](../windows.applicationmodel.useractivities/useractivity.md) encapsulates a user's task that can be continued at a later time, and potentially on a different device. For example, a mail app could create a UserActivity when the user starts creating a new email message. The user could pause working on the email and then work on it later on the same machine, or even another device.

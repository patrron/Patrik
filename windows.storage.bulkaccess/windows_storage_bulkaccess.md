# Windows.Storage.BulkAccess

## -description
Provides classes for searching, accessing, managing, and retrieving information about files and folders in the storage system.

Provides quick access and retrieval of file and folder properties that are also available directly off [StorageFile](../windows.storage/storagefile.md) or [StorageFolder](../windows.storage/storagefolder.md) objects (by using synchronous operations). These classes can be used to bind file system items to JavaScript [ListView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c58cccc9-7f85-4b13-a0d5-7f584f2ca4e6) or XAML [ListView](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/listview.md) and [GridView](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/gridview.md) controls.

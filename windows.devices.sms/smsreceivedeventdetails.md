# Windows.Devices.Sms.SmsReceivedEventDetails

## -description
Presents the details of SMS message events to the background work item that handles messages while your app is suspended.

> [!NOTE]
> This functionality is only available to mobile operator apps and UWP apps given privileged access by mobile network operators, mobile broadband adapter IHV, or OEM. For more information, see [Mobile Broadband:  device apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/mobilebroadband/index).

> [!NOTE]
> Note that this class and its methods are supported for the maintenance of legacy desktop apps that used it in earlier versions of Windows; and if you do use this class, you must specify the **Windows.Devices.Sms.LegacySmsApiContract** in your app's manifest. Do not use this class if you are developing new apps for Windows 10. Instead, use the members of this namespace that do not require the **Windows.Devices.Sms.LegacySmsApiContract**.

## -remarks
Windows extends battery life by suspending applications that are not in the foreground. If your application needs to handle new SMS messages even while it is suspended, it needs to create a background work item to handle this. When a new SMS message arrives, the background work item is activated.

# Windows.Graphics.Printing.PrintTask.IsPreviewEnabled

## -description
Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the [PrintTask](printtask.md) will show a print preview.

## -property-value
True, if print preview is enabled.

## -remarks
In some situations, displaying the print preview will take too much time and disrupt the user experience of a Universal Windows app. For this reason, the developer may wish to disable the print preview feature in favor of a smoother control flow.

By default, **isPreviewEnabled** is **true**. UWP apps that are meant to print in the background must set **isPreviewEnabled** to **false**.

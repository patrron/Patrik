# Windows.Graphics.Printing.PrintManager.PrintTaskRequested

## -description
Raised when a request to print has occurred. This event may be triggered by user action or via programmatic invocation of printing via the [ShowPrintUIAsync](printmanager_showprintuiasync_1397448831.md) method.

## -remarks
When you add print capabilities to your UWP app, you have to implement an event handler to process this event when it is raised. Here is a JavaScript code snippet that shows how to handle this event:





```javascript
// Print event handler for printing via the PrintManager API.
// printEvent contains the print task request object
    function onPrintTaskRequested(printEvent) {    
        var printTask = printEvent.request.createPrintTask("Print Sample", function (args) {
            args.setSource(MSApp.getHtmlPrintDocumentSource(document));
    });

```

# Windows.Media.Audio.AudioGraph.Stop

## -description
Stops the audio graph.

## -remarks
Starting and stopping the audio graph does not affect the state of the individual nodes in the graph. Calling [Start](audiograph_start_1587696324.md) on the audio graph causes all nodes that are in the started state to be processed.

# Windows.Media.Audio.AudioNodeEmitter.DopplerVelocity

## -description
Gets or sets a [Vector3](../windows.foundation.numerics/vector3.md) expressing the velocity at which the emitter is moving in 3D space, expressed in meters per second.

## -property-value
A [Vector3](../windows.foundation.numerics/vector3.md) expressing the velocity at which the emitter is moving.

## -remarks
By default, the doppler velocity is expressed in meters per second. Set the [DopplerScale](audionodeemitter_dopplerscale.md) property to scale the value to use other units.

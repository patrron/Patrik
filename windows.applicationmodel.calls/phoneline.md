# Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.PhoneLine

## -description
Represents a phone line.

## -remarks
A phone line is a line on a device that can either receive incoming calls or place outgoing calls, depending on whether the line is configured to support dialing out. For example, a single SIM device has 1 cellular line while a dual SIM device has 2 cellular lines. The system will automatically create new lines for VoIP applications that allow initiating an outgoing call.

Each [PhoneLine](phoneline.md) instance has properties specific to that line.

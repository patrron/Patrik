## -remarks

TintLuminosityOpacity controls how much color saturation is visible through the surface where Acrylic is applied. A higher value (measured from 0.0 to 1.0) means more color is seen through the surface; a lower value means less color is seen.

TintLuminosityOpacity also helps balance any blacks or whites behind the Acrylic.

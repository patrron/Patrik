# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.PathGeometry.Figures

## -description
Gets or sets the collection of [PathFigure](pathfigure.md) objects that describe the contents of a path.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<PathGeometryÂ Figures="moveAndDrawCommands"/>
```

```xaml
<PathGeometry>
  <PathGeometry.Figures>
    oneOrMoreFigures
  </PathGeometry.Figures>
</PathGeometry>
```


## -xaml-values
<dl><dt>moveAndDrawCommands</dt><dd>moveAndDrawCommandsA string that defines move and draw commands. For more info see Move and draw commands syntax.</dd>
<dt>oneOrMoreFigures</dt><dd>oneOrMoreFiguresOne or more PathFigure object elements.</dd>
</dl>
## -property-value
A collection of [PathFigure](pathfigure.md) objects that describe the contents of a path. Each individual [PathFigure](pathfigure.md) describes a shape.

## -remarks
The main reason you'd want more than one [PathFigure](pathfigure.md) is if you want to consider the overall [PathGeometry](pathgeometry.md) as one vector drawing that can "restart" the line in a different place, and use [IsClosed](pathfigure_isclosed.md) to close up each figure.

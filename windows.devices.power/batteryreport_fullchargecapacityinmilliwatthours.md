# Windows.Devices.Power.BatteryReport.FullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours

## -description
Gets the fully-charged energy capacity of the battery.

## -property-value
The fully-charged energy capacity of the battery, in milliwatt-hours (mWh).

> Note: Some devices report their battery capacity in milliamp-hours (mAh) instead of mWh. As a rough heuristic, if the value reported is lower than 4400 it is likely represented in mAh, otherwise it is in mWh.

## -remarks
FullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours is used by the capacity ratio to estimate battery health.

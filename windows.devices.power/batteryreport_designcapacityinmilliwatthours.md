# Windows.Devices.Power.BatteryReport.DesignCapacityInMilliwattHours

## -description
Gets the estimated energy capacity of a new battery of this type.

## -property-value
The estimated energy capacity of a new battery of this type, in milliwatt-hours (mWh).

## -remarks
This property is not supported by all battery controllers. Some battery controllers might return the same value as [FullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours](batteryreport_fullchargecapacityinmilliwatthours.md) or return no value at all.

When this property is supported, the capacity ratio is the ratio of [FullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours](batteryreport_fullchargecapacityinmilliwatthours.md) to DesignCapacityInMilliwattHours. [FullChargeCapacityInMilliwattHours](batteryreport_fullchargecapacityinmilliwatthours.md) is used in this way because the full charge capacity typically changes with battery wear.

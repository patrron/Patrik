Provides types for interacting with the Wallet feature of Windows Phone from a Windows Runtime app.

<!--CUT: "Apps can add and manage wallet items, define payment instruments, and interact with NFC and the Secure Element." WinRT API does not have full set of API that Microsoft.Phone.Wallet had. Notably absent are PaymentInstrument class and related, and the entire Microsoft.Phone.SecureElement API. NFC for WinRT has its own API, also smartcards namespace.-->

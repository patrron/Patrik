# Windows.Foundation.Metadata.PlatformAttribute

## -description
Declares the platform that a type should be supported in, when platform-specific metadata is produced.

## -remarks
<!--TODO consider whether worth mentioning that in post MDMERGE metadata this attribute can only exist as an assembly-level attribute. In that context, a better desc might be, declares the platform that info in a metadata assembly applies to. The current desc is a hedge on what it represents rather than what it's currently doing in this implementation of a metadata system-->

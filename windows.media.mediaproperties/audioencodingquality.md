# AudioEncodingQuality

## -description
Describes the level of quality of the audio encoding. The higher the quality, the better the audio fidelity, and the larger the resulting file.

The quality of encoded audio is determined by several factors. 
+ The number of channels represented. One channel for monophonic, and two channels for stereo.
+ The digital sampling rate. This must be at least double the frequency of the highest pitch you want to reproduce.
+ The digital sampling resolution. This is also known as the bit-depth. + 8-bit provides a low resolution with 256 descrete levels.
+ 16-bit provides a moderate resolution with 65,536 descrete levels.
+ 24-bit and 32-bit provide high resolutions.

+ The amount of lossy compression used to encode the audio.


## -enum-fields
### -field Auto:0
**Auto** fills in the proper settings based on the current camera settings. So when **Auto** is used, settings that are manually modified are ignored. For example, if you create a preset profile using one the static create methods, such as [CreateM4a](mediaencodingprofile_createm4a_1230065862.md), and specify **Auto** as the encoding quality, any changes you make to the properties will be overwritten with values based on the current camera settings.

### -field High:1
Stereo, Professional audio sampling rate (48 kHz), 192 kilobits per second (kbps) data transfer rate.

### -field Medium:2
Stereo, CD quality sampling rate (44.1 kHz), 128 kilobits per second (kbps) data transfer rate.

### -field Low:3
Mono, CD quality sampling rate (44.1 kHz), 96 kilobits per second (kbps) data transfer rate.

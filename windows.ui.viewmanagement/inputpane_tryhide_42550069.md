If this method is called from an app that is not in foreground, the request is rejected and **false** is returned.

## -remarks

If you set [CoreTextEditContext.InputPaneDisplayPolicy](../windows.ui.text.core/coretexteditcontext_inputpanedisplaypolicy.md) to **Manual** in your app, you are responsible for showing and hiding the input pane using TryShow and TryHide.

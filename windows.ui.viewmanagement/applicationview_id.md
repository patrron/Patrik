# Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView.Id

## -description
Gets the ID of the window (app view).

## -property-value
The ID of the window. It is unique for all windows managed by the app.

## -remarks
The property is a nonstatic member of the window object. For JavaScript, this means that it is a property of the window object that [getForCurrentView](applicationview_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md) creates, not of the [ApplicationView](applicationview.md) class.

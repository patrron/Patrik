# Windows.UI.ViewManagement.UISettings.TextScaleFactor

## -description
Gets the value of the system text size setting.

## -property-value
The value ranges from 1 to 2. Very small text is scaled up by a factor equal to this value, or very close to it. You can use the value to scale non-text visuals proportionately with the text. But be aware that not all text is scaled by the same factor. Generally speaking, the larger text is to begin with, the less itâ€™s affected by scaling.

# Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView.IsOnLockScreen

## -description
Gets whether the window (app view) is on the Windows lock screen.

## -property-value
**true** if the calling window is on the lock screen; **false** if it is not.

## -remarks
The property is a nonstatic member of the window object. For JavaScript, this means that it is a method of the window object that [getForCurrentView](applicationview_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md) creates, not of the [ApplicationView](applicationview.md) class.

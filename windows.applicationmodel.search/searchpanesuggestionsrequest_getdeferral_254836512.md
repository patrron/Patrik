# Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchPaneSuggestionsRequest.GetDeferral

## -description
Retrieves an object that lets an app respond to a request for suggestions asynchronously.

## -returns
An object that lets an app signal when it has fulfilled the request for search suggestions.

## -remarks
Your app should respond asynchronously to a request for search suggestions if fulfilling the request will take a significant amount of time, such as fetching suggestions from a web service.

Use the [searchPaneSuggestionsRequestDeferral.complete](searchpanesuggestionsrequestdeferral_complete_1807836922.md) method to signal when your app has fulfilled the request.

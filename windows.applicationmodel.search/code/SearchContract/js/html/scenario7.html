            Demonstrates how to let users begin typing as a way to open the search charm while they are in your app.
            If your app participates in the Search contract, consider adding this feature to your app's main page and
            your app's search results page so that users can access the Search charm quickly while they are using a keyboard.
            Note: Users can still use the keyboard to navigate your app after you enable type to search.

            Type using your keyboard to open the Search charm.

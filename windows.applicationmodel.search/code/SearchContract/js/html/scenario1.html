            Participating in the Search contract lets users search within your app by selecting your app from the 
            scope selector in the Search charm. We recommend that you place a search glyph on your app canvas that 
            programmatically invokes the Search pane - this will ensure the pane is properly scoped for the user.<br /><br />
            Follow these steps to see how users select an app (with this contract) to search from the Search charm:
        </p>

            2. Type in a query<br/>
            3. Submit the query<br/>
            4. Select a different app in the search pane<br/>
            5. Submit a new query<br/>
            6. Switch back to Search contract Sample app in the Search Pane

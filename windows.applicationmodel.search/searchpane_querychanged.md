# Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchPane.QueryChanged

## -description
Fires when the user changes the text in the search box.

## -remarks
> [!NOTE]
> An app can't use both the search box ([Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.SearchBox](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/searchbox.md) for UWP app using C++, C#, or Visual Basic, [WinJS.UI.SearchBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/dn301949(v=win.10)) for Windows app using JavaScript) and the [SearchPane](searchpane.md). Using both the search box and the search pane in the same app causes the app to throw an exception with this message: "Cannot create instance of type 'Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.SearchBox.'"

Register to be notified when this event fires by adding an event listener to the [searchPane](searchpane.md) and assigning a handler function for the event. You can access information about the event with the [searchPaneQueryChangedEventArgs](searchpanequerychangedeventargs.md) object that is passed to your event handler.

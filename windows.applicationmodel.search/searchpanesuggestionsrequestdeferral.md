# Windows.ApplicationModel.Search.SearchPaneSuggestionsRequestDeferral

## -description
Enables the app to signal when it has finished populating a [searchSuggestionCollection](searchsuggestioncollection.md) object while handling the [suggestionsrequested](searchpane_suggestionsrequested.md) event. Apps should use a deferral if and only if they need to respond to a request for suggestions asynchronously.

## -remarks
Your app should respond asynchronously to a request for suggestions if fulfilling the request will take a significant amount of time, such as fetching suggestions from a web service.

Use the [searchPaneSuggestionsRequestDeferral.complete](searchpanesuggestionsrequestdeferral_complete_1807836922.md) method to signal when your app has fulfilled the request.

An app retrieves this object by calling the [searchPaneSuggestionsRequest.getDeferral](searchpanesuggestionsrequest_getdeferral_254836512.md) method while handling the [suggestionsrequested](searchpane_suggestionsrequested.md) event.

## -examples
The [Search contract sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=234892) demonstrates how to respond to a [suggestionsrequested](searchpane_suggestionsrequested.md) event, including how to get a deferral.

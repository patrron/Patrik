## -remarks
An application's PackageFamilyName can be obtained via the [PackageID class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.PackageId#Windows_ApplicationModel_PackageId_FamilyName)

A PackageFamilyName can vary depending on how an application has been published, but it will generally follow the form of `[package name]_[publisher_id]`. For example, an unpublished app has a family name similar to `c04742a8-1c87-41c1-b951-cc6e6f353400_g3nsfcgfwzqga`

# Windows.System.AppMemoryReport.ExpectedTotalCommitLimit

## -description
Gets the expected commit limit for the current app.

## -property-value
The expected commit limit in bytes.

## -remarks
When an app launches on Xbox, it is initially given a small commit limit (the sum of the appâ€™s available usage of private plus shared commit memory) which may grow as the system frees memory. This property returns the expected upper limit.

When an app launches on a non-Xbox system, the commit limit the app gets at launch remains the same and this property will return the same value as [Windows.System.AppMemoryReport.TotalCommitLimit](appmemoryreport_totalcommitlimit.md).

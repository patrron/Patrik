# Windows.Storage.FileIO.WriteBufferAsync

## -description
Writes data from a buffer to the specified file.

## -parameters
### -param file
The file that the buffer of data is written to.

### -param buffer
The buffer that contains the data to write.

## -returns
No object or value is returned when this method completes.

## -remarks

## -examples
The [File Access sample]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231445) shows you how to use WriteBufferAsync to write data from a buffer to a file.

```csharp

try
{
    if (file != null)
    {
        IBuffer buffer = CryptographicBuffer.GenerateRandom(10);
        await FileIO.WriteBufferAsync(file, buffer);
        // Perform additional tasks after file is written
    }
}
// Handle errors with catch blocks
catch (FileNotFoundException)
{
    // For example, handle file not found
}
```

```javascript

if (file !== null) {
    // Create buffer
    var buffer = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.generateRandom(10);

    // Write buffer to file
    Windows.Storage.FileIO.writeBufferAsync(file, buffer).done(function () {
        // Perform additional tasks after file is written
    },
    // Handle errors with an error function
    function (error) {
        // Handle errors encountered during write
    });
}
```

In the example, `file` is a local variable that contains a [storageFile](storagefile.md) that represents the file to write.

Although the writeBufferAsync methods don't have a return value, you can still perform additional tasks after the text is written to the file, as the example shows.

# Windows.Devices.Printers.Print3DDevice

## -description
Represents a 3D printer.

## -remarks
Use the AQS string returned by [GetDeviceSelector](print3ddevice_getdeviceselector_838466080.md) with the [DeviceInformation](../windows.devices.enumeration/deviceinformation.md) APIs to find all 3D printers that are connected to the device. Once you have a [DeviceInformation](../windows.devices.enumeration/deviceinformation.md) object for a 3D printer, you can use that object's [Id](../windows.devices.enumeration/deviceinformation_id.md) property value as the *deviceId* parameter in [FromIdAsync](print3ddevice_fromidasync_1322863552.md) to create a Print3DDevice object.

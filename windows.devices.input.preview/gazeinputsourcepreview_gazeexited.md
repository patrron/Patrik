## -description

Occurs when the eye-tracking device detects that the [gaze point](gazepointpreview.md) has moved outside the bounding area of the element.

## -remarks

This event fires only in response to a [gaze point](gazepointpreview.md) leaving the bounding area of an element where a [GazeEntered](gazeinputsourcepreview_gazeentered.md) event already occurred.

# Windows.UI.Text.ITextRange.EndOf

## -description
Moves or extends the text range to the end of the nearest specified text unit. The text range is moved or extended forward in the document.

## -parameters
### -param unit
The unit by which to move the end position of the text range.

### -param extend
True extends the text range by moving just the end position of the range to the end of the specified *unit*. False moves both ends of the text range to the end of the specified *unit*. The default value is false.

## -returns
The number of character positions that the range was moved or extended, plus 1 if the text range collapsed to the start of the range. If the text range includes the final carriage return (CR) at the end of the story, and *extend* is false, the return value is set to â€“1 to indicate that the collapse occurred before the end of the range. This is because an insertion point cannot exist beyond the final CR.

## -remarks
If the range is an insertion point on a boundary between units, the EndOf method does not change the end position of the range.

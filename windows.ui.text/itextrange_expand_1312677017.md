# Windows.UI.Text.ITextRange.Expand

## -description
Expands a text range to completely contain any partial text units.

## -parameters
### -param unit
The text unit to use to expand the range. The default value is **Word**.

## -returns
The number of characters added to the text range, if the range was expanded to include a partially contained *unit*.

## -remarks
For example, if the insertion point is at the beginning, the end, or inside a word, the Expand method expands the range to include that word. If the range already includes one word and part of another, Expand expands the range to include both words.

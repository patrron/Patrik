# Windows.UI.Text.FontWeights

## -description
Provides a set of predefined font weights as static property values.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml

          See XAML Syntax for FontWeight
        
```


## -remarks
In standard typography API, the weight of a font is expressed by using constant names, for example "Bold". Using constant names for setting a font weight property is supported through type converter behaviors and also by the [FontWeights](fontweights.md) support class. For code access, the relevant information is expressed as the **Weight** factor of a [FontWeight](fontweight.md) value.

# Windows.ApplicationModel.Calls.Provider.PhoneCallOriginManager.SetCallOrigin

## -description
Sets the call origin when a phone call comes in.

## -parameters
### -param requestId
The unique identifier for this phone call. This is retrieved from the *targetId* of the [PhoneCallOriginDataRequestTriggerDetails](../windows.applicationmodel.calls.background/phonecallorigindatarequesttriggerdetails.md)

### -param callOrigin
The call information for the incoming call.

## -remarks
Before attempting to call this method, make sure of the following.
+ You declare the **PhoneCall** capability in your app manifest file as follows: `<uap:Capability Name="phoneCall" />`
+ Your application has a background task that binds the [PhoneCallOriginDataRequestTriggerDetails](../windows.applicationmodel.calls.background/phonecallorigindatarequesttriggerdetails.md) trigger.
+ Your application is the active call origin application. You can use [IsCurrentAppActiveCallOriginApp](phonecalloriginmanager_iscurrentappactivecalloriginapp.md) to determine if this is true. If your app is not the currently active application, you can use [ShowPhoneCallOriginSettingsUI](phonecalloriginmanager_showphonecalloriginsettingsui_1617140504.md) to display a window to the user enabling them to change the currently active origin app.


If any of these are not true, SetCallOrigin will return an access denied error.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your application uses the **phoneCall** capability, you must request a waiver if you want to publish your application in China. Contact your premier support representative if you need the waiver.

This method should be invoked in the background when the application is triggered by the [PhoneCallOriginDataRequestTriggerDetails](../windows.applicationmodel.calls.background/phonecallorigindatarequesttriggerdetails.md).

The following example shows how to set the location of the origin in response to a trigger.

# Windows.Devices.Sensors.LightSensor.ReadingChanged

## -description
Occurs each time the ambient-light sensor reports a new sensor reading.

## -remarks
An application may register this event handler to obtain sensor readings. The application must establish a desired [ReportInterval](lightsensor_reportinterval.md). This informs the sensor driver that resources should be allocated to satisfy the requirements of the application.

Applications can set the frequency of this event by setting the **ReportInterval** property.

The following example demonstrates how a UWP app built with C# and XAML registers its **ReadingChanged** event handler.

The following example shows the ReadingChanged event handler.

The following example demonstrates how a UWP app bulit with JavaScript registers its **ReadingChanged** event handler.

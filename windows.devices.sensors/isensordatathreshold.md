# Windows.Devices.Sensors.ISensorDataThreshold

## -description
Identifies a threshold for sensor data. When this threshold is crossed, the sensor trigger will activate.

## -remarks
Sensors can support different types of thresholds depending on the type of sensor involved. For example, a pedometer could support having a threshold that will trigger if the number of steps exceeds a set value. On the other hand, a proximity could have a threshold that is activated when the sensor state changes.

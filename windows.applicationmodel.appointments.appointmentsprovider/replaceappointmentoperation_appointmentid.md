# Windows.ApplicationModel.Appointments.AppointmentsProvider.ReplaceAppointmentOperation.AppointmentId

## -description
Gets the unique identifier of the appointment to replace.

## -property-value
The unique identifier of the appointment to replace.

## -remarks
The identifier is typically a value that the appointments provider app previously returned through an [AddAppointmentOperation.ReportCompleted](addappointmentoperation_reportcompleted_458863373.md) call. If the identifier doesn't correspond to any known appointment, the appointment doesn't exist in the userâ€™s calendar. Because the user's intent was to replace the original appointment, we recommend that the appointment provider app create a new appointment and add it to the calendar.
<!--and probably should not display UI? without an ID to lookup the info there would be nothing useful to display-->

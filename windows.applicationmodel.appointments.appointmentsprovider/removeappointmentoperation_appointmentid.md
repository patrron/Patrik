# Windows.ApplicationModel.Appointments.AppointmentsProvider.RemoveAppointmentOperation.AppointmentId

## -description
Gets the unique identifier of the appointment to remove.

## -property-value
The unique identifier of the appointment to remove.

## -remarks
The identifier is usually a value the appointment provider app previously returned through an [AddAppointmentOperation.ReportCompleted](addappointmentoperation_reportcompleted_458863373.md) call. If the identifier doesn't correspond to any known appointment, the appointment doesn't exist in the userâ€™s calendar. Because the user's intent was to remove the appointment, we recommend that you treat the operation as successful.
<!--and probably should not display UI? without an ID to lookup the info there would be nothing useful to display-->

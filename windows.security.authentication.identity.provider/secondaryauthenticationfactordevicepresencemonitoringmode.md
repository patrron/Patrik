# Windows.Security.Authentication.Identity.Provider.SecondaryAuthenticationFactorDevicePresenceMonitoringMode

## -description
**Deprecated.** Contains values that describe the type of connection that the system uses to monitor the presence of a companion device (such as a wearable device). 

> [!NOTE]
> This API is not available to all apps. Unless your developer account is specially provisioned by Microsoft to use the **secondaryAuthenticationFactor** capability, calls to this API will fail. To apply for approval, contact [cdfonboard@microsoft.com](mailto:cdfonboard@microsoft.com). For more information on capabilities, see [App capability declarations](https://aka.ms/appcap). For an overview of the Companion Device Framework, see the [Windows Unlock with companion (IoT) devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/security/companion-device-unlock) overview.

## -enum-fields
### -field Unsupported:0
Device presence monitoring is not supported.

### -field SystemManaged:2
The system uses classing Bluetooth protocol to monitor the presence of the companion device.

### -field AppManaged:1
The system uses an app that corresponds to the companion device to monitor its presence.

## -remarks
A companion device must specify this value when registering for presence monitoring. If the companion device has only registered for secondary authentication and not presence monitoring, its corresponding [SecondaryAuthenticationFactorInfo](SecondaryAuthenticationFactorInfo.md) will show a default value of *unsupported*.

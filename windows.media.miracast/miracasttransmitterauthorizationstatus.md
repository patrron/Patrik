# Windows.Media.Miracast.MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus

## -description

Specifies the authorization status of a Miracast Transmitter.

## -enum-fields
### -field Undecided:0

A decision has not yet been made about whether to allow or block this transmitter.

### -field Blocked:3

All connection attempts from this transmitter are automatically rejected.

### -field AlwaysPrompt:2

Connections from this transmitter are allowed, but always ask the user to confirm a new connection.

### -field Allowed:1

Connections from this transmitter are allowed.

## -remarks

When a new Miracast connection is received, [MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod](miracastreceiverauthorizationmethod.md) controls which type of authorization, if any, should be applied. (E.g., whether to display a PIN, or ask the user to approve the connection attempt.)

But the MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus value can override the [MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod](miracastreceiverauthorizationmethod.md).
A value of MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Blocked causes incoming connections from the specified Transmitter to be automatically rejected without prompting the user.

When the value is MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Allowed, the effective [MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod](miracastreceiverauthorizationmethod.md) value becomes MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod.None, i.e., the user is not prompted and no PIN is displayed.

When the value is MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.AlwaysPrompt, the effective [MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod](miracastreceiverauthorizationmethod.md) value becomes MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod.ConfirmConnection, i.e., the user is prompted even if a PIN authorization is requested.

[MiracastReceiverSettings.RequireAuthorizationFromKnownTransmitters](miracastreceiversettings_requireauthorizationfromknowntransmitters.md) overrides the above if the value has been set to true.
In that case, values of MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Allowed and MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.AlwaysPrompt are treated the same way as the value MiracastTransmitterAuthorizationStatus.Undecided, which means that the [MiracastReceiverAuthorizationMethod](miracastreceiverauthorizationmethod.md) value controls the authorization method.

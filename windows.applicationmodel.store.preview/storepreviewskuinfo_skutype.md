## -description
Gets a string that specifies the type of the in-app product SKU.

## -property-value
A string that specifies the type of the in-app product SKU.
<!--Per feedback from Sarah Waskom, as of Threshold RTM valid strings are "Full", "Subscription", and "SubscriptionTrial". However, we will introduce more later, and we don't want to document "Subscription" and "SubscriptionTrial" for RTM because the subscription feature won't be public until TH2. Since no one apart from Microsoft can use this API as of RTM anyway, we are not documenting any of these string values for the time being.-->

# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Imaging.XamlRenderingBackgroundTask.OnRun

## -description
Performs the work of the background task. The system calls this method when the associated background task has been triggered.

## -parameters
### -param taskInstance
An interface to an instance of the background task. The system creates this instance when the task has been triggered to run.

## -remarks
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To keep the memory footprint of the background task as low as possible, this task should be implemented in a C++ Windows Runtime Component for Windows Phone. The memory footprint will be higher if written in C# and will cause out of memory exceptions on low-memory devices which will terminate the background task. For more information on memory constraints, see [Support your app with background tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/support-your-app-with-background-tasks).

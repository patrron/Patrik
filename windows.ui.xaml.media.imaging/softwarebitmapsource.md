# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Imaging.SoftwareBitmapSource

## -description
Provides a source object, backed by a [SoftwareBitmap](../windows.graphics.imaging/softwarebitmap.md), for properties that use a bitmap-format image source.

## -remarks
SoftwareBitmapSource lets you to use a [SoftwareBitmap](../windows.graphics.imaging/softwarebitmap.md) as an image source to be displayed using an [ImageBrush](../windows.ui.xaml.media/imagebrush.md) or directly in an [Image](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/image.md) control. For example, you can use a SoftwareBitmapSource to display a photo just taken by a device's camera using the [LowLagPhotoCapture](../windows.media.capture/lowlagphotocapture.md) class, to display an image you have manually decoded using the [BitmapDecoder.GetSoftwareBitmapAsync](../windows.graphics.imaging/bitmapdecoder_getsoftwarebitmapasync_1163471917.md) method, or to display a custom [IWICBitmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincodec/nn-wincodec-iwicbitmap) in advanced C++ scenarios where you want to manually manage image memory.

A [SoftwareBitmap](../windows.graphics.imaging/softwarebitmap.md) displayed in a XAML app must be in BGRA pixel format with pre-multiplied alpha values.

A [SoftwareBitmap](../windows.graphics.imaging/softwarebitmap.md) typically stores uncompressed image data. This means it can require a large amount of system memory compared to a compressed format like a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) or JPEG file. Therefore, using a [SoftwareBitmap](../windows.graphics.imaging/softwarebitmap.md) can increase the amount of system memory your app is using, which could impact your appâ€™s performance. Because storing uncompressed image data can use a lot of memory, you can call the [Dispose](softwarebitmapsource_dispose.md) (C#/VB) or [Close](softwarebitmapsource_close_811482585.md) (C++) method to reduce memory usage when the [SoftwareBitmap](../windows.graphics.imaging/softwarebitmap.md) is longer needed. This causes the associated system resources to be freed immediately rather than waiting for garbage collection.

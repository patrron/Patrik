# Windows.UI.Text.Core

## -description

Provides types for accessing the Windows core text APIs and the text input server. Windows core text is a client-server system that centralizes the processing of keyboard input into a single server. You can use it to manipulate the edit buffer of your custom text input control; the text input server ensures that the contents of your text input control and the contents of its own edit buffer are always in sync via an asynchronous communication channel between the application and the server.

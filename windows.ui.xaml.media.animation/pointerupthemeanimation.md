# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.PointerUpThemeAnimation

## -description
Represents a preconfigured animation that runs after a pointer down is detected on an item or element and the tap action is released.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<PointerUpThemeAnimation .../>
```

## -remarks
Setting the [Duration](timeline_duration.md) property has no effect on this object as the duration is preconfigured.

PointerUpThemeAnimation overrides the current values of [Projection](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_projection.md) and [RenderTransform](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_rendertransform.md) and sets them to their default values.

> **WindowsÂ 8.1 and prior**
> [Projection](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_projection.md) and [RenderTransform](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_rendertransform.md) are not affected by [PointerDownThemeAnimation](pointerdownthemeanimation.md).

## -examples
See the code example in [PointerDownThemeAnimation](pointerdownthemeanimation.md).

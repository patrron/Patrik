# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.PointAnimation.By

## -description
Gets or sets the total amount by which the animation changes its starting value.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<PointAnimationÂ By="x,y"/>
```


## -xaml-values
<dl><dt>x</dt><dd>xThe x-value of the Point that specifies the animation increment.</dd>
<dt>y</dt><dd>yThe y-value of a Point that specifies the animation increment.</dd>
</dl>
## -property-value
The total amount by which the animation changes its starting value. The default is **null**.

<!--Projection dochack:-->
If you are programming using C#or Microsoft Visual Basic, the type of this property is projected as **Point?**(a nullable [Point](../windows.foundation/point.md)).

## -remarks
A [PointAnimation](pointanimation.md) typically has at least one of the [From](pointanimation_from.md), By or [To](pointanimation_to.md) properties set, but never all three. For more info, see Remarks in [PointAnimation](pointanimation.md).

The **null** default value indicates that the base non-animated value is the default value for By, not that the animated value is literally **null**. The base non-animated value is determined at run time by the dependency property system. For more info, see [Dependency properties overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/dependency-properties-overview).

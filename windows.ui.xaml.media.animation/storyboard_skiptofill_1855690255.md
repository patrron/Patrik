# Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Animation.Storyboard.SkipToFill

## -description
Advances the current time of the storyboard's clock to the end of its active period.

## -remarks
If you call this method on an animation that doesn't have a [FillBehavior](timeline_fillbehavior.md) value of **HoldEnd**, this has the same effect as calling [Stop](storyboard_stop_1201535524.md).

This method is mainly relevant for methods that are playing or paused, and which don't have infinite repeat. Calling SkipToFill on an infinite animation or an animation that's already stopped has no effect.


<!--What about if Begin hasn't been called yet?-->

## -description
Gets or sets the event data for a print notification event.

## -property-value
The print notification event data.

## -remarks
The  property is nested XML that is formatted as string. To get this property, parse for the Bidi request and response schema that is embedded in an `<Envelope>`, following the AsyncUI's [balloonUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/print/balloonui) element message, which contains the [action](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/print/action) element. The [action](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/print/action) element contains the `<Envelope>` where the Bidi response schema is found. Examine the Bidi response to determine the cause of the event.

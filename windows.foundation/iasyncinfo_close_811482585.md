# Windows.Foundation.IAsyncInfo.Close

## -description
Closes the asynchronous operation.

## -remarks
Calling this method indicates that you have finished with the results of the operation. After calling Close, do not call the **GetResults** method again (each of the 4 [IAsyncInfo](iasyncinfo.md) derived interfaces have their own implementation of **GetResults**.)

<!--Is this a Notes to Callers? It's a weird note for implementation purposes.-->

# Windows.Foundation.Deferral.Close

## -description
If the [DeferralCompletedHandler](deferralcompletedhandler.md) has not yet been invoked, this will call it and drop the reference to the delegate.

## -remarks
If the [DeferralCompletedHandler](deferralcompletedhandler.md) has not yet been invoked, this will call it and drop the reference to the delegate. Otherwise, since Close must be safe to call multiple times, this will simply succeed without doing anything.

# Windows.Foundation.PropertyValue

## -description
Represents a value in a property store (such as a [PropertySet](../windows.foundation.collections/propertyset.md) instance).

## -remarks
PropertyValue represents the value portion of a property that typically has a string name, and some value. There are multiple properties in a property set, and each property potentially has a different value type, so from a collection standpoint the collection is mixed, not strongly typed. The [PropertySet](../windows.foundation.collections/propertyset.md) class and the [IPropertySet](../windows.foundation.collections/ipropertyset.md) interface are existing interfaces or implementations that use this model and use a PropertyValue as the value part of a key-value pair. [IPropertySet](../windows.foundation.collections/ipropertyset.md) is the type of various Windows Runtime properties where the goal is to provide your app with a *property bag* of properties that are conceptually related in their origin, but each property might (and often does) use a different value type.

When used by other Windows Runtime APIs and their signatures, values are often passed as the [IPropertyValue](ipropertyvalue.md) interface rather than as the PropertyValue type.

In addition to representing the value itself, PropertyValue defines utility methods that populate a PropertyValue instance. Calling these utility methods from app code is uncommon. The methods create a boxed value, and in this aspect a PropertyValue instance functions similarly to the **VARIANT** concept from Component Object Model (COM). Each method has a matched method that creates an array of values as opposed to a single value.

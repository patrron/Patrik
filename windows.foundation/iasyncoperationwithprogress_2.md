# Windows.Foundation.IAsyncOperationWithProgress<TResult, TProgress>

## -description
Represents an asynchronous operation that can report progress updates to callers. This is the return type for many Windows Runtime asynchronous methods that have results and also report progress.

## -remarks
IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; is the return type for many Windows Runtime asynchronous methods that have a result upon completion, and also support notifications that report progress (which callers can subscribe to by assigning a callback for [Progress](iasyncoperationwithprogress_2_progress.md)). This constitutes about 100 different Windows Runtime APIs. APIs that don't report progress (but do have a result) use another interface, [IAsyncOperation&lt;TResult&gt;](iasyncoperation_1.md).

When you use methods that return IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; (with a **TResult** specific constraint) in your app code, you usually don't access the IAsyncOperationWithProgress return value directly. That's because you almost always use the language-specific awaitable syntax. In this case, the apparent return value of the method is the type provided as the **TResult** parameter. For more info, see [Asynchronous programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/threading-async/asynchronous-programming-universal-windows-platform-apps), or one of the language-specific guides to Windows Runtime asynchronous programming ([Call asynchronous APIs in C# or Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/threading-async/call-asynchronous-apis-in-csharp-or-visual-basic), [C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/threading-async/asynchronous-programming-in-cpp-universal-windows-platform-apps), [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh700330(v=win.10))).


<!--There do not appear to be utilities eg ThreadPool that use IAsyncOperation-->
It's not common to use IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; directly even if you don't use a language-specific awaitable syntax. Each of the languages has extension points that are generally easier to use than the Windows Runtime interface. JavaScript has [WinJS.Promise](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/br211867(v=win.10)), and the **then/done** syntax. .NET has the [AsTask](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system?redirectedfrom=MSDN) extension method, and once the IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; is converted to a [Task&lt;TResult&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task?redirectedfrom=MSDN), it's easier to get the result, cancel, get notification on completion, and so on. For C++/CX, you can wrap the calls using the [Concurrency runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/parallel/concrt/reference/concurrency-namespace) (and use [create_task](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/parallel/concrt/reference/concurrency-namespace-functions?view=vs-2017)). In other words, IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; can be considered runtime-level infrastructure, which each of the languages use as a framework to support awaitable syntax or asynchronous programming models in their own way.

Specifically, if you want to handle progress in .NET code, use the **AsTask** signature that in an extension usage has a single [IProgress](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.iprogress-1?redirectedfrom=MSDN) reference parameter. (In this usage, the progress unit is already constrained and matches the IAsyncOperationWithProgress method you're using.) Provide an object that implements [IProgress](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.iprogress-1?redirectedfrom=MSDN), and your [Report](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.iprogress-1.report?redirectedfrom=MSDN#System_IProgress_1_Report__0_) method implementation is invoked each time the Windows Runtime method reports a progress notification.

To monitor the progress of the action (if not using the language-specific techniques described above), set the [Progress](iasyncoperationwithprogress_2_progress.md) property, providing it the name of a method that implements the [AsyncOperationProgressHandler&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt;](asyncoperationprogresshandler_2.md) delegate.


<!--Not sure there are custom operation types that also have progress-->
### Interface inheritance

IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; inherits [IAsyncInfo](iasyncinfo.md). Types that implement IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; also implement the interface members of [IAsyncInfo](iasyncinfo.md): 
+ [Cancel](iasyncinfo_cancel_1985564044.md) method
+ [Close](iasyncinfo_close_811482585.md) method
+ [ErrorCode](iasyncinfo_errorcode.md) property
+ [Id](iasyncinfo_id.md) property
+ [Status](iasyncinfo_status.md) property


### Notes to implementers

As with calling the existing methods, there are language-specific ways to define asynchronous methods that don't use IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult,TProgress&gt; directly. If writing code using .NET, your method can return a [Task&lt;TResult&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task?redirectedfrom=MSDN). For C++/CX, you can use the [Concurrency runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/parallel/concrt/reference/concurrency-namespace). However, if you're defining a [ component](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh441572(v=vs.140)), you can use **Task**/**task** internally but you must return one of the Windows Runtime interfaces for your public methods. The language-specific asynchronous support types (and many other language-specific types you might conventionally use in code) can't be used for the public surface area of a Windows Runtime component.

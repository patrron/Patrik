# Windows.Foundation.WwwFormUrlDecoder.WwwFormUrlDecoder

## -description
Creates and initializes a new instance of the [WwwFormUrlDecoder](wwwformurldecoder.md) class.

## -parameters
### -param query
The URL to parse.

## -remarks
The query string must start with a '?' character.

Any '&amp;' character encountered represents a new name-value pair. If there is a '=' character present in the string, the substring to the left of the '=' character is the name and the right substring is the value.

The constructor doesn't do much validation on the string beyond verifying that it isn't **null** or the wrong type. If your input doesn't correctly represent a query string that starts with '?' and contains name-value pairs separated by '&amp;', the collection contents are empty or invalid, and calls to [GetFirstValueByName](wwwformurldecoder_getfirstvaluebyname_186006860.md) won't have the expected result.

URL-encoded characters are not decoded, they are simply included in the name-value pairs.

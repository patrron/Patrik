# Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.MobileBroadbandDeviceInformation.CurrentRadioState

## -description
Gets a value indicating the radio state of the device.

## -property-value
A value indicating the radio state of the device.

## -remarks
Mobile operator UWP apps can have access to different states of the device. Access to the device states such as device readiness, account activation state, and device lock status are made available through the [NetworkDeviceStatus](networkdevicestatus.md) enumeration. The radio state information is available through the CurrentRadioState enumeration. Note that these are two different states. For example, a radio state **Off** does not translate to a **DeviceNotReady** state and vice versa.

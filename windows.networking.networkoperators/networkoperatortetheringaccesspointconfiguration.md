## -description
Provides the ability to configure and create a [NetworkOperatorTetheringAccessPointConfiguration](networkoperatortetheringaccesspointconfiguration.md) object that contains a specific network account ID (SSID) and specifies the passphrase used to authenticate clients trying to establish a network connection to the tethering network.

## -remarks

It is likely to stop working. 

The Mobile Hotspot and Wi-Fi Direct technology cannot run at the same time. 
Mobile Hotspot takes precedence over all Wi-Fi Direct scenarios.

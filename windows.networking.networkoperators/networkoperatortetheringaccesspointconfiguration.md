# Windows.Networking.NetworkOperators.NetworkOperatorTetheringAccessPointConfiguration

## -description
Provides the ability to configure and create a NetworkOperatorTetheringAccessPointConfiguration object that contains a specific network account ID (SSID) and specifies the passphrase used to authenticate clients trying to establish a network connection to the tethering network.

## -remarks
Windows 10, version 1607, supports Mobile Hotspot, an enhanced version of the mobile broadband tethering feature. The Mobile Hotspot and Wi-Fi Direct technology can't both run at the same time. Mobile Hotspot takes precedence over all Wi-Fi Direct scenarios. For example, screen projection and tethering can't both run at the same time.

# Windows.Web.AtomPub.AtomPubClient.DeleteResourceItemAsync

## -description
Deletes an existing Entry or Media Link resource. This differs from the [DeleteResourceAsync](atompubclient_deleteresourceasync_1093618628.md) method in that the [SyndicationItem](../windows.web.syndication/syndicationitem.md) object that represents the resource to be deleted is specified instead of the Uri. The DeleteResourceItemAsync method uses the  property of the specified [SyndicationItem](../windows.web.syndication/syndicationitem.md) as the Uri of the resource to be deleted.

## -parameters
### -param item
The resource to be deleted.

## -returns
The object that is used to delete the resource asynchronously and to report the progress and completion status of the operation.

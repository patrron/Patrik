# Windows.Perception.Spatial.SpatialAnchorTransferManager

## -description
Static methods for transferring spatial anchors between devices, so that both devices can reason about the same locations in their users' surroundings.

## -remarks
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SpatialAnchorTransferManager approach of sharing spatial anchors between devices is being deprecated.  In a future release of Windows, you will need to transition to the [SpatialAnchorExporter](spatialanchorexporter.md) API, which provides for sharing and relocalization of spatial anchors across devices.

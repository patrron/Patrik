# Windows.Perception.Spatial.SpatialAnchorTransferManager

## -description
Static methods for transferring spatial anchors between devices, so that both devices can reason about the same locations in their users' surroundings.

## -remarks
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The export/import approach of sharing spatial anchors between devices is being deprecated.  In a future release of Windows, you will need to transition to the [SpatialEntityStore](spatialentitystore.md) API, which provides a shared pool of spatial anchors and metadata, which the system will synchronize on your behalf.

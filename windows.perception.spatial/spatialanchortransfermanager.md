# Windows.Perception.Spatial.SpatialAnchorTransferManager

## -description
Static methods for transferring spatial anchors between devices, so that both devices can reason about the same locations in their users' surroundings.

## -remarks
> [!NOTE]
> Local anchor transfers using **SpatialAnchorTransferManager** provide less robust anchor recall than [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors), and iOS and Android devices are not supported by this approach.

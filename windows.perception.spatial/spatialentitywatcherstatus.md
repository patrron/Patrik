# Windows.Perception.Spatial.SpatialEntityWatcherStatus

## -description
Describes the state of a [SpatialEntityWatcher](spatialentitywatcher.md) object.

## -enum-fields
### -field Created:0
This is the initial state of a Watcher object. During this state clients can register event handlers.

### -field Started:1
The watcher transitions to the Started state once [Start](spatialentitywatcher_start_1587696324.md) is called. The watcher is enumerating the initial collection. Note that during this enumeration phase it is possible to receive [Updated](spatialentitywatcher_updated.md) and [Removed](spatialentitywatcher_removed.md) notifications but only to items that have already been [Added](spatialentitywatcher_added.md).

### -field EnumerationCompleted:2
The watcher has completed enumerating the initial collection. Items can still be added, updated or removed from the collection.

### -field Stopping:3
The client has called [Stop](spatialentitywatcher_stop_1201535524.md) and the watcher is still in the process of stopping. Events may still be raised.

### -field Stopped:4
The client has called [Stop](spatialentitywatcher_stop_1201535524.md) and the watcher has completed all outstanding events. No further events will be raised.

### -field Aborted:5
The watcher has aborted operation. No subsequent events will be raised.

## -remarks
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [SpatialEntityStore](spatialentitystore.md) approach of synchronizing spatial anchors between devices is not currently supported.  Consider using [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors) instead.

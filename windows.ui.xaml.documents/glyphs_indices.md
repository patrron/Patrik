# Windows.UI.Xaml.Documents.Glyphs.Indices

## -description

Gets or sets a collection of glyph specifications that represents the Glyphs object.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<GlyphsÂ Indices="string"/>
```

## -property-value

A collection of glyph specifications that represents the Glyphs object.
A string that defines the position of a glyph in the font as well as other glyph specifics in a string mini-language. The default is an empty string.

## -remarks

A sequence of glyphs forms a single cluster. The specification of the first glyph in the cluster is preceded by a specification of how many glyphs and how many code points combine to form the cluster. The Indices property collects in one string the following properties:

- Glyph indices
- Glyph advance widths
- Combining glyph attachment vectors
- Cluster mapping from code points to glyphs
- Glyph flags

Each glyph specification has the following form.

`[GlyphIndex][,[Advance][,[uOffset][,[vOffset][,[Flags]]]]]`

# Windows.UI.Xaml.Documents.LineBreak

## -description
Represents an inline element that causes a new line to begin in content when rendered in a text container.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<LineBreak />
```


## -remarks
LineBreak is most commonly used when formatting text within the [TextBlock.Inlines](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/textblock_inlines.md) collection. [RichTextBlock](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/richtextblock.md) supports the [Paragraph](paragraph.md) element as an element that separately renders text blocks, so you don't typically need to use LineBreak content as often. (LineBreak is supported in the [RichTextBlock](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/richtextblock.md) text model, for example you can place a LineBreak in [Paragraph.Inlines](paragraph_inlines.md), between other [Run](run.md) or [Span](span.md) elements, and a line break will render at that position.)

LineBreak inherits properties from the [TextElement](textelement.md) class. However, most of these properties don't have any visible effect. It's most common to declare a LineBreak object element in XAML without there being any attributes set, similar to how you might use a `<br/>` tag in HTML.

Setting properties on LineBreak that otherwise affect the character line height of a text element (such as [FontSize](textelement_fontsize.md), [FontFamily](textelement_fontfamily.md)) has no effect on the text rendering and appearance. The height of a text line is inferred from the other text elements that precedes the LineBreak, and the properties of a LineBreak don't modify that line height even if set explicitly.

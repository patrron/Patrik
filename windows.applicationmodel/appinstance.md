# Windows.ApplicationModel.AppInstance

## -description
Represents an instance of an app.

## -remarks
The system maintains a cache of app instances. Apps can use this cache for redirection of an app when it attempts to activate.

When an app process is created in the `Main` method of the app, it can choose to continue to activate the current instance, or to redirect the activation to an existing instance.

The shell can provide a preferred instance for redirection. The app is encouraged to redirect to that instance. The choice of whether to redirect remains with the app.

The [AppInstance](AppInstance.md) class is intended to be used in the `Main` method of the app. If this class is used later, the property values may be `null`, and the methods may fail.

Before any instances can be returned, they must be registered with [FindOrRegisterInstanceForKey](appinstance_findorregisterinstanceforkey_1124409949.md).

This class can only be used from an app that has opted in to multi-instancing. Specify the **SupportsMultipleInstances** attribute on the [Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-application) element in the package manifest for the app.

# Windows.ApplicationModel.EnteredBackgroundEventArgs.GetDeferral

## -description
Gets the deferral object which delays the transition from running in the background state to the suspended state until the app calls [Deferral.Complete](../windows.foundation/deferral_complete_1807836922.md) or the deadline for navigation has passed.

## -returns
The deferral object you will use to indicate when your processing is complete.

## -remarks
Deferrals are important if you call asynchronous methods from your event handler. Without the deferral, the app transitions to the next state when the event handler returnsâ€” which could happen before your asynchronous method has finished.

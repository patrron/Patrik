# Windows.ApplicationModel.LeavingBackgroundEventArgs.GetDeferral

## -description
Gets the deferral object which delays the transition from running in the background to running in the foreground until the app calls [Deferral.Complete](../windows.foundation/deferral_complete_1807836922.md) or the deadline for navigation has passed.

## -returns
The deferral object you will use to indicate that your processing is done.

## -remarks
Deferrals are important if you call asynchronous methods from your event handler. Without the deferral, the app transitions to the next state when the event handler returnsâ€” which may happen before your asynchronous method has finished.

# Windows.UI.Composition.Core.CompositorController

## -description

Represents a compositor on which intended composition changes must be explicitly committed.

## -remarks

The CompositorController lets you create and control a compositor on which you must explicitly commit your intended composition changes. This is in contrast to the compositor you obtain from a visual returned by a call to ElementCompositionPreview.GetElementVisual, for which commits occur implicitly without requiring a direct call.

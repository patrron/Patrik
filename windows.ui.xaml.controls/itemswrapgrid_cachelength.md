# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.ItemsWrapGrid.CacheLength

## -description
Gets or sets the size of the buffers for items outside the viewport, in multiples of the viewport size.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
ItemsWrapGrid CacheLength="double" />
```


## -property-value
The size of the buffers for items outside the viewport, in multiples of the viewport size. The default is 4.0.

## -remarks
To improve scrolling performance, [ItemsWrapGrid](itemswrapgrid.md) creates and caches item containers for items that are off-screen on both sides of the viewport. The CacheLength property specifies the size of the buffers for the off-screen items. You specify CacheLength in multiples of the current viewport size. For example, if the CacheLength is 4.0, 2 viewports worth of items are buffered on each side of the viewport.

You can set a smaller cache length to optimize startup time, or set a larger cache size to optimize scrolling performance. Item containers that are off-screen are created at a lower priority than those in the viewport.

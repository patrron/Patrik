# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.StyleSelector

## -description
Enables custom item style selection logic as a function of the content data and its specific item container.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
See Remarks
```


## -remarks
The base StyleSelector class is not used as an object element in XAML. However, it is a common scenario to derive a custom StyleSelector, map a xmlns prefix for the custom class and its namespace/assembly, and then refer to an instance of the custom class as defined in a [Resources](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_resources.md) block in XAML. This makes it possible to refer to the custom template selector class by **x:Key**, and use that reference to set the value of properties such as [ItemContainerStyleSelector](itemscontrol_itemcontainerstyleselector.md) in XAML templates and particular visual states.

# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.WebViewBrush.Redraw

## -description
Causes the [WebViewBrush](webviewbrush.md) to get updated source pixels from the associated [WebView](webview.md) and its current content. This happens asynchronously.

## -remarks
A [WebViewBrush](webviewbrush.md) is basically a snapshot of the content being displayed in a [WebView](webview.md). It won't show animations or any dynamic changes to the content. Call Redraw if the source [WebView](webview.md) has changed its content significantly and you want to make a new snapshot to display as the [WebViewBrush](webviewbrush.md) content.

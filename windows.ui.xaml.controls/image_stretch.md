# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Image.Stretch

## -description
Gets or sets a value that describes how an [Image](image.md) should be stretched to fill the destination rectangle.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<Image Stretch="stretchValue"/>
```


## -xaml-values
<dl><dt>stretchValue</dt><dd>stretchValueA named constant of the Stretch enumeration, such as Uniform.</dd>
</dl>
## -property-value
A value of the [Stretch](../windows.ui.xaml.media/stretch.md) enumeration that specifies how the source image is rendered, if the [Height](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_height.md) and/or [Width](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_width.md) of the [Image](image.md) are not explicitly specified. The default value is **Uniform**.

## -remarks
The value of the Stretch property is only relevant if the [Image](image.md) instance is not already using explicitly set values for the [Height](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_height.md) and/or [Width](../windows.ui.xaml/frameworkelement_width.md) property, and if the [Image](image.md) instance is inside a container that can stretch the image to fill some available space in layout. If you set the value of the Stretch property to **None**, the image always retains its natural size, even if there's a layout container that might stretch it otherwise. For more info on image sizing, see Remarks in [Image](image.md).

### Image sources and scaling

You should create your image sources at several recommended sizes, to ensure that your app looks great when Windows 8 scales it because of device scaling and resolution. This is often a better way to handling image resizing rather than applying a nondefault Stretch value. When specifying a [Source](image_source.md) for an [Image](image.md), you can use a naming convention that will automatically reference the correct resource for the current scaling. For specifics of the naming convention and more info, see [Quickstart: Using file or image resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh965325(v=win.10)).

For more info on how to design for scaling, see [UX guidelines for layout and scaling](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design).

> [!NOTE]
> A Stretch value of **None** doesn't work for image resources that are intended to support scaling. The scaling will be detected and the appropriate scaled resource is loaded before the layout decisions implied by the **None** value are applied.

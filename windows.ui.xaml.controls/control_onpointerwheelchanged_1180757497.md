## -remarks
<!--The following remark is relevant for Windows 8 > 8.1 migration. See WBB 462116-->
### Windows 8 behavior

For Windows 8, track pad device gestures that were input-handled by a [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) control part were interpreted as mouse wheel input, and thus would fire a [PointerWheelChanged](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_pointerwheelchanged.md) event. Starting with Windows 8.1, [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) uses an underlying manipulation logic that interprets track pad gestures as actions that the [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) responds to, and thus the gesture is considered handled by the control and the [PointerWheelChanged](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_pointerwheelchanged.md) event is not fired anymore.

If you migrate your app code from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 you may want to account for this behavior change, because it results in [PointerWheelChanged](../windows.ui.xaml/uielement_pointerwheelchanged.md) being fired in fewer cases. Also, the behavior that's now built-in to [ScrollViewer](scrollviewer.md) may be duplicating what your handler would have done.

Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 continue to use the Windows 8 behavior.

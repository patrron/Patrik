public void Frame.SetNavigationState(String navigationState, Boolean suppressNavigate)
-->

# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Frame.SetNavigationState

## -description
Reads and restores the navigation history of a [Frame](frame.md) from a provided serialization string.

## -parameters
### -param navigationState
The serialization string that supplies the restore point for navigation history.

### -param suppressNavigate
**true** to restore navigation history without navigating to the current page; otherwise, **false**. 

## -remarks
If you call **SetNavigationState** with the **suppressNavigate** parameter set to **true**, [Page.OnNavigatedTo](page_onnavigatedto_1083052518.md) is not called for the current page. The current page is also put into the BackStack. When suppressing the transition, also be sure to use GoBack or GoForward to navigate to the correct page in the navigation history. NavigateTo is also supported, however the forward stack will be cleared when it is used.

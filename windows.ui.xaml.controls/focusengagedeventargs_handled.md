# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.FocusEngagedEventArgs.Handled

## -description
Gets or sets a value that marks the routed event as handled. A **true** value for **Handled** prevents most handlers along the event route from handling the same event again.

Equivalent WinUI property: [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.FocusEngagedEventArgs.Handled](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.focusengagedeventargs.handled).

## -property-value
**true** to mark the routed event handled. **false** to leave the routed event unhandled, which permits the event to potentially route further and be acted on by other handlers. The default is **false**.

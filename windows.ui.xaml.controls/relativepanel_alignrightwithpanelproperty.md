# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RelativePanel.AlignRightWithPanelProperty

## -description
Identifies the [RelativePanel.AlignRightWithPanel](relativepanel_alignrightwithpanel.md)  XAML attached property.

## -property-value
The identifier for the [RelativePanel.AlignRightWithPanel](relativepanel_alignrightwithpanel.md)  XAML attached property.

## -remarks
This property is only an identifier for the property system, and isn't used in most app scenarios. In most cases you set the [RelativePanel.AlignRightWithPanel](relativepanel_alignrightwithpanel.md)  XAML attached property in XAML and won't need this identifier.

To access the [RelativePanel.AlignRightWithPanel](relativepanel_alignrightwithpanel.md) attached property in code, you can use the dependency property system, calling either [GetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_getvalue.md) or [SetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_setvalue.md) and passing [RelativePanel.AlignRightWithPanelProperty](relativepanel_alignrightwithpanelproperty.md) as the dependency property identifier. Another way to get or set the value in code is to use [GetAlignRightWithPanel](relativepanel_getalignrightwithpanel.md) and [SetAlignRightWithPanel](relativepanel_setalignrightwithpanel.md).

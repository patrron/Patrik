An object that represents the image source file for the drawn image. Typically you set this with a [BitmapImage](../windows.ui.xaml.media.imaging/bitmapimage.md) object, constructed with the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that describes the path to a valid image source file. Or, you can initialize a [BitmapSource](../windows.ui.xaml.media.imaging/bitmapsource.md) with a stream, perhaps a stream from a storage file.

# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RelativePanel.AlignLeftWithProperty

## -description
Identifies the [RelativePanel.AlignLeftWith](relativepanel_alignleftwith.md)  XAML attached property.

## -property-value
The identifier for the [RelativePanel.AlignLeftWith](relativepanel_alignleftwith.md)  XAML attached property.

## -remarks
This property is only an identifier for the property system, and isn't used in most app scenarios. In most cases you set the [RelativePanel.AlignBottomWith](relativepanel_alignbottomwith.md)  XAML attached property in XAML and won't need this identifier.

To access the [RelativePanel.AlignLeftWith](relativepanel_alignleftwith.md) attached property in code, you can use the dependency property system, calling either [GetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_getvalue_1188551207.md) or [SetValue](../windows.ui.xaml/dependencyobject_setvalue_52578133.md) and passing [RelativePanel.AlignLeftWithProperty](relativepanel_alignleftwithproperty.md) as the dependency property identifier. Another way to get or set the value in code is to use [GetAlignLeftWith](relativepanel_getalignleftwith_2107664912.md) and [SetAlignLeftWith](relativepanel_setalignleftwith_945797910.md).

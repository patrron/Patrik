Reset the energy usage total by calling [ResetTotalEnergyUsage](foregroundenergydiagnostics_resettotalenergyusage_1916149566.md).

The energy usage of a foreground app is classified into one these predefined levels, from lowest to highest energy consumption: [LowUsageLevel](../windows.system.power/foregroundenergymanager_lowusagelevel.md), [NearMaxAcceptableUsageLevel](../windows.system.power/foregroundenergymanager_nearmaxacceptableusagelevel.md), [MaxAcceptableUsageLevel](../windows.system.power/foregroundenergymanager_maxacceptableusagelevel.md), or [ExcessiveUsageLevel](../windows.system.power/foregroundenergymanager_excessiveusagelevel.md).

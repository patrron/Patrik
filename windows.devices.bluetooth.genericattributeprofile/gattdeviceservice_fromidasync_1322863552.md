## -remarks
The first time this method is invoked by a store app, it should be called from a UI thread in order to display the consent prompt. After the user has granted consent, the method can be invoked from any application thread.

If a store app has not declared the right capabilities or the user does not grant consent, the method returns a null object.


For WindowsÂ 10Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, use the **bluetooth** capability. For more info see [App capability declarations](https://aka.ms/appcap).For Windows 8.x store apps, see [How to specify device capabilities for Bluetooth (Windows)](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/how-to-specify-device-capabilities-for-bluetooth) to declare the right capabilities.

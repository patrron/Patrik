# Windows.Networking.Vpn.VpnPacketBufferList.First

## -description
Not supported. Provides access to the First parameter. This SDK programming element is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## -returns
Returns **IVpnPacketBuffer**.

## -remarks
<!--Begin NET note for IEnumerable support-->
You can iterate through a [VpnPacketBufferList](vpnpacketbufferlist.md) in C# or Microsoft Visual Basic. In many cases, such as using **foreach** syntax, the compiler does this casting for you and you won't need to cast to `IEnumerable<VpnPacketBuffer>` explicitly. If you do need to cast explicitly, for example if you want to call [GetEnumerator](XREF:TODO:M:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1.GetEnumerator), cast to [IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;](XREF:TODO:T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1) with a [VpnPacketBuffer](vpnpacketbuffer.md) constraint.

# Windows.Media.Playback.IMediaPlaybackSource

## -description

A marker interface that identifies the implementing class as a playback source.

## -remarks

This interface doesn't define any methods. This interface is implemented by classes used by the media playback framework, such as [MediaPlaybackItem](mediaplaybackitem.md), 
so that the system can identify them as playback sources. This interface is not intended to be used directly by apps.

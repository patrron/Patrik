# Windows.Graphics

## -description
Provides basic data types that contain info on how to draw graphics. These data structs are commonly used to define how large surfaces are drawn when using the [CompositionVirtualDrawingSurface](../windows.ui.composition/compositionvirtualdrawingsurface.md) class. 

Virtual surfaces can be used to create large, efficient scrollable regions in an app; useful for scenarios such as maps and long scrollable blocks of text.

# Windows.Services.Store.StoreProduct

## -description
Represents a product that is available in the Microsoft Store.

## -remarks
Products in the Store are organized in a hierarcy of *product*, *SKU*, and *availability* objects. Products are represented by **StoreProduct** objects. The SKUs for each product are represented by [StoreSku](storesku.md) objects, and the availabilities for each SKU are represented by [StoreAvailability](storeavailability.md) objects. For more information, see [In-app purchases and trials](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/monetize/in-app-purchases-and-trials).

To retrieve a **StoreProduct** object for the current app, use the [GetStoreProductForCurrentAppAsync](storecontext_getstoreproductforcurrentappasync_128036649.md) method. 

To retrieve **StoreProduct** objects for products that can be purchased from within the current app, use these methods.

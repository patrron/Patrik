# Windows.Services.Store.StoreSku

## -description
Provides info for a stock keeping unit (SKU) of a product in the Microsoft Store.

## -remarks
A SKU is a code that uniquely identifies a particular version of a product or service. It is a very common term used in the field of inventory management. Products in the Store are organized in a hierarcy of *product*, *SKU*, and *availability* objects. Products are represented by [StoreProduct](storeproduct.md) objects. The SKUs for each product are represented by **StoreSku** objects, and the availabilities for each SKU are represented by [StoreAvailability](storeavailability.md) objects. For more information, see [In-app purchases and trials](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/monetize/in-app-purchases-and-trials).

To access the SKUs for a product, use the [Skus](storeproduct_skus.md) property of the [StoreProduct](storeproduct.md) for the product in which you are interested.

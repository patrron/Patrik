# Windows.Services.Store.StoreRequestHelper.SendRequestAsync

## -description
Sends the specified request to the Windows Store with the provided context and parameters.

## -parameters
### -param context
An object that specifies the user for which to perform the operation. If your app is a single-user app (that is, it runs only in the context of the user that launched the app), use the [StoreContext.GetDefault](storecontext_getdefault_846721868.md) method to get a [StoreContext](storecontext.md) object that you can use to send a request that operates in the context of the user. If your app is a multi-user app, use the [StoreContext.GetForUser](storecontext_getforuser_2058550280.md) method to get a [StoreContext](storecontext.md) object that you can use to send a request that operates in the context of a specific user.

### -param requestKind
A value that identifies the request that you want to send to the Windows Store.

### -param parametersAsJson
A JSON-formatted string that contains the arguments to pass to the request.

## -returns
An asynchronous operation that, on successful completion, returns a [StoreSendRequestResult](storesendrequestresult.md) object that provides status and error info about the request.

## -remarks
This method is intended to be used to send requests to the Windows Store for operations that do not yet have a corresponding API available in the Windows SDK. For more information about using this method, including details about the requests that are currently available, see [Send requests to the Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/monetize/send-requests-to-the-store).

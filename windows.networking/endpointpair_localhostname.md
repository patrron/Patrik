# Windows.Networking.EndpointPair.LocalHostName

## -description
Get or set the local hostname for the [EndpointPair](endpointpair.md) object.

## -property-value
The local hostname for the [EndpointPair](endpointpair.md) object.

## -remarks
The LocalHostName property can contain a local hostname or an IP address.

The LocalHostName property can be set to one of the following:


+ The name of the local host that can be resolved by the Domain Name System (DNS) or by another namespace provider.
+ The name of the local host that matches a string in the following file on the local computer: *%WINDIR%\\system32\drivers\etc\hosts*
+ A string that contains an IPv4 or an IPv6 network address of the local host. An IPv4 address string is in dotted-decimal notation ("192.168.1.111", for example). An IPv6 address is in hexadecimal notation ("21DA:00D3:0010:2F3B:02AA:00FF:FE28:9C5A", for example).
When this property is set to the "localhost" string, this represents all loopback addresses on the local computer.

The [NetworkInformation.GetHostNames](../windows.networking.connectivity/networkinformation_gethostnames_136280557.md) method in the [Windows.Networking.Connectivity](../windows.networking.connectivity/windows_networking_connectivity.md) namespace can be used to retrieve a list of hostnames or IP addresses associated with the local machine. The LocalHostName property can then be set to one of these hostnames or IP addresses.

The LocalHostName property can also be set to null. If the LocalHostName property is null before a network connection is established by a client app, then the system will automatically provide the local IP address for the app to use.

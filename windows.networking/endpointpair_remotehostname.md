# Windows.Networking.EndpointPair.RemoteHostName

## -description
Get or set the remote hostname for the [EndpointPair](endpointpair.md) object.

## -property-value
The remote hostname for the [EndpointPair](endpointpair.md) object.

## -remarks
The RemoteHostName property can contain a hostname or an IP address to connect to. The remote hostname must be supplied for the remote endpoint of the [EndpointPair](endpointpair.md) object before a network connection can be established by a client app.

The RemoteHostName property can be set to one of the following:


+ The name of the remote host that can be resolved by the Domain Name System (DNS) or by another namespace provider.
+ The name of the host that matches a string in the following file on the local computer: *%WINDIR%\\system32\drivers\etc\hosts*
+ A string that contains an IPv4 or an IPv6 network address of the remote host. An IPv4 address string is in dotted-decimal notation ("192.168.1.111", for example). An IPv6 address is in hexadecimal notation ("21DA:00D3:0010:2F3B:02AA:00FF:FE28:9C5A", for example).
When this property is set to the "localhost" string, this represents all loopback addresses on the local computer.

It is an error to set the RemoteHostName property to null or an empty string.

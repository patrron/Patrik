# Windows.UI.Xaml.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.IsPassword

## -description
Gets a value that indicates whether the element contains sensitive content.

Equivalent WinUI method: [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Automation.Peers.AutomationPeer.IsPassword](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.automation.peers.automationpeer.ispassword).

## -returns
**true** if the element contains sensitive content such as a password; otherwise, **false**.

## -remarks
This property enables applications such as screen readers to determine whether the text content of a control should be read aloud.


<!--This remark taken from the RTM .NET documentation. I don't think you should shorten 'applications' to 'apps' here because screen readers are desktop applications that well predate Windows 8; there will probably never be a true screen reader "app" because it requires system integration that the Windows 8 appmodel will never make available to a developer.-->

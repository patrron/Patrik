# Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geofencing.Geofence.StartTime

## -description
The time to start monitoring the [Geofence](geofence.md).

## -property-value
The time to start monitoring the geofence. The default value is 0, which is the beginning of time, epoch.

## -remarks
A geofence is made active when the StartTime is in the past. If the device is within the geofence's area when it becomes active and the geofence is being monitored for the **Entered** state, then the geofence will trigger as soon as the [DwellTime](geofence_dwelltime.md) requirement has been met. However, if the device is outside of the geofence when it becomes active, the geofence does not instantly switch to the **Exited** state. The device must enter a geofence, remain inside for the specified [DwellTime](geofence_dwelltime.md), and then exit in order to switch to the **Exited** state.

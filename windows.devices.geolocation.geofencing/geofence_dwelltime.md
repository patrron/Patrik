# Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geofencing.Geofence.DwellTime

## -description
The minimum time that a position has to be inside or outside of the [Geofence](geofence.md) in order for the notification to be triggered.

## -property-value
The minimum time that a position has to be inside or outside of the geofence in order for the notification to be triggered.

## -remarks
When creating geofences that use a dwell time, the time span must be greater than 0.

The **DwellTime** value is used for monitoring both the **Entered** and **Exited** states of a single geofence. If you want to provide different dwell time values for entering and exiting, you should create two [Geofence](geofence.md) objects, using one to track the **Entered** state and another to track the **Exited** state. Then you can specify a different dwell time for each object.

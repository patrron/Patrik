# Windows.Devices.Geolocation.Geofencing.GeofenceMonitor

## -description
Contains the information about the monitored [Geofence](geofence.md) objects.

## -remarks
Use the static [Current](geofencemonitor_current.md) property to get the [GeofenceMonitor](geofencemonitor.md) object which contains all of an appâ€™s geofence information.

You will receive an **IDS_GEOFENCEMONITOR_OUT_OF_SYNC** exception if the Location Framework Service event state is out of synchronization with the [GeofenceMonitor](geofencemonitor.md). You can attempt to recover by removing all event handlers on the [GeofenceMonitor](geofencemonitor.md) or restarting the application. Once all event handlers have been removed, you may add back any event handlers and retry the operation.

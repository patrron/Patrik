# Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.ContactPicker

## -description

Controls how the Contact Picker user interface opens and what information it shows.

## -remarks

The ContactPicker class enables users to select one or more contacts from any app that supports the Contact Picker contract. You can configure the ContactPicker class to accept only a single contact, or multiple contacts. In addition, you can request that the app providing the contact information return the entire set of data for each contact, or just specific fields.

> [!NOTE]
> Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 may encounter runtime errors without compile-time errors.

For more info about how to select contacts, see [Select contacts](/windows/uwp/contacts-and-calendar/selecting-contacts).

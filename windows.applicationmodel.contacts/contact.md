# Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.Contact

## -description

Represents a contact.

## -remarks

No matter how you store contact information in your app, you must be able to put that information into a Contact object. This way, other apps that allow users to select contacts can use your app and process the contact information it provides.

For info about how to manage contacts, see [Contacts and calendar](/windows/uwp/contacts-and-calendar/).

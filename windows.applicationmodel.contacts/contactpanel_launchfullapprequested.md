## -description
Occurs when the user clicks the **Launch Full App** button in the Contact Panel.
## -remarks
Handle this event to provide your users with a smoother experience. For example, your app could handle this event to ensure that the full app continues playing a video that users start in the Contact Panel, or open a message that users started reading in the Contact Panel.
If you don’t handle this event, or if you handle this event, but you don’t set the [Handled](contactpanellaunchfullapprequestedeventargs_handled.md) property of the [ContactPanelLaunchFullAppRequestedEventArgs](contactpanellaunchfullapprequestedeventargs.md) property to true, your app starts in it’s default state.

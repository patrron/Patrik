# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.FlyoutBase.LightDismissOverlayMode

## -description
Gets or sets a value that specifies whether the area outside of a *light-dismiss* UI is darkened.

## -property-value
A value of the enumeration that specifies whether the area outside of a light-dismiss UI is darkened. The default is **Auto**.

## -remarks
Transient UI, such as a [Flyout](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/flyout.md) or [MenuFlyout](../windows.ui.xaml.controls/menuflyout.md), closes when you click or tap outside of it. This is called light-dismiss. "Overlay" refers to the area outside of a light-dismiss UI.

By default, the "overlay" is darkened on the Xbox, and not darkened on other devices families. You can set LightDismissOverlayMode to **On** to make your app darken the "overlay" area on all device families, or set it to **Off** to not darken the "overlay" area on all device families.

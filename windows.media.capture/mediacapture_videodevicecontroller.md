## -description
Gets an object that controls settings for the video camera.

## -property-value
A [VideoDeviceController](../windows.media.devices/videodevicecontroller.md) object.

## -remarks
Some drivers may require that the camera device preview to be in a running state before it can determine which controls are supported by the VideoDeviceController. If you check whether a certain control is supported by the VideoDeviceController before the preview stream is running, the control may be described as unsupported even though it is supported by the video device.

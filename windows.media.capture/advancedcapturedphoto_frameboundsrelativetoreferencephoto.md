# Windows.Media.Capture.AdvancedCapturedPhoto.FrameBoundsRelativeToReferencePhoto

## -description
Gets a reference to a [Rect](../windows.foundation/rect.md) that expresses the dimensions of the [Frame](advancedcapturedphoto_frame.md) generated by the advanced photo capture operation, relative to the reference photo passed into the [OptionalReferencePhotoCaptured](advancedphotocapture_optionalreferencephotocaptured.md) event.

## -property-value
A reference to a [Rect](../windows.foundation/rect.md) that expresses the frame bounds of the captured frame relative to a reference photo.

## -remarks
Due to the image processing involved, a frame captured with [AdvancedPhotoCapture](advancedphotocapture.md) may be smaller than the preview photo that is passed into the [OptionalReferencePhotoCaptured](advancedphotocapture_optionalreferencephotocaptured.md) event. This property allows you to crop the preview frame so that it matches the dimensions of the processed frame.



> [!NOTE]
> Not all capture devices support providing a reference photo for advanced photo capture or determining the dimensions of the reference photo, so this property may be null. Be sure to check for a null reference before using the value of this property.

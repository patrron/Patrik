# Windows.Media.Capture.LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture.StopAsync

## -description
Asynchronously stops capturing photos.

## -returns
Object that is used to control the asynchronous operation.

## -remarks
StopAsync stops the operation, which can be restarted with [StartAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_startasync_1931900819.md).

[FinishAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_finishasync_1182664592.md) stops the photo sequence capture operation and releases the [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object and resources used by the photo sequence operation. If you want to restart the photo sequence operation after calling [FinishAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_finishasync_1182664592.md), you must call [MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoSequenceCaptureAsync](mediacapture_preparelowlagphotosequencecaptureasync_2130225421.md) to initialize a new [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object.

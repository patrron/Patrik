# Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture.ThermalStatusChanged

## -description
Occurs when the thermal status of the capture device changes.

## -remarks
Media capture scenarios that are extremely processor-intensive, such as high-resolution, high-frame rate, and real-time image processing can cause the capture hardware to overheat. On devices where the camera driver supports reporting of thermal status, you can check the [MediaCaptureThermalStatus](mediacapture_thermalstatus.md) property to get the current thermal status of the capture device. You can also subscribe to the ThermalStatusChanged event to receive a notification when the thermal status changes. If the thermal status is [Overheated](mediacapturethermalstatus.md) , you should stop the current capture session and save any captured media. Once the thermal status has returned to normal, you can begin capturing again.

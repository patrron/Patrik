# Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoSequenceCaptureAsync

## -description
Initializes the low shutter lag photo sequence capture and provides the [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object used to manage the recording.

## -parameters
### -param type
The encoding profile used for the image.

## -returns
When this method completes, a [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object is returned which can be used to start the photo sequence capture.

## -remarks
Use MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoSequenceCaptureAsync to initialize the photo sequence capture. This is an asynchronous call which returns a [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object when it is finished, which is used start the photo sequence capture by calling [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture.StartAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_startasync_1931900819.md).

PrepareLowLagPhotoSequenceCaptureAsync must be called before [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture.StartAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_startasync_1931900819.md).

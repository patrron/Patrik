# Windows.Media.Capture.LowLagPhotoCapture

## -description
Provides methods for taking a low shutter lag photo.

## -remarks
Use [MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoCaptureAsync](mediacapture_preparelowlagphotocaptureasync_1426375994.md) to initialize the capture. This is an asynchronous calls which returns a LowLagPhotoCapture object when it is finished. This must be called before [CaptureAsync](lowlagphotocapture_captureasync_2078018041.md).

[FinishAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_finishasync_1182664592.md) stops the photo capture operation and releases the LowLagPhotoCapture object and resources used by the capture photo operation. After starting a low lag photo capture, you must stop the photo capture by calling [FinishAsync](lowlagmediarecording_finishasync_1182664592.md) before your app attempts to record video with the [MediaCapture](mediacapture.md) object.

If the media type is changed or an effect is added, you must call [MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoCaptureAsync](mediacapture_preparelowlagphotocaptureasync_1426375994.md) to create a new LowLagPhotoCapture object.

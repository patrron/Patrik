# Windows.Media.Capture.LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture.FinishAsync

## -description
Asynchronously releases the [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object and resources used by the photo sequence capture operation.

## -returns
Object that is used to control the asynchronous operation.

## -remarks
FinishAsync stops the photo sequence capture operation and releases the [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object and resources used by the photo sequence operation. If you want to restart the photo sequence operation after calling FinishAsync, you must call [MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoSequenceCaptureAsync](mediacapture_preparelowlagphotosequencecaptureasync_2130225421.md) to initialize a new [LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture](lowlagphotosequencecapture.md) object.

[StopAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_stopasync_1648475005.md) stops the operation, which can be restarted with [StartAsync](lowlagphotosequencecapture_startasync_1931900819.md).

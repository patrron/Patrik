# Windows.Media.Capture.LowLagPhotoSequenceCapture.StartAsync

## -description
Asynchronously starts capturing photos.

## -returns
Object that is used to control the asynchronous operation.

## -remarks
[MediaCapture.PrepareLowLagPhotoSequenceCaptureAsync](mediacapture_preparelowlagphotosequencecaptureasync_2130225421.md) must be called before StartAsync.

Add a handler to the [PhotoCaptured](lowlagphotosequencecapture_photocaptured.md) event in order to get the captured photos in the sequence. [PhotoCapturedEventArgs](photocapturedeventargs.md) provides the data for the captured frames. [PhotoCapturedEventArgs.Frame](photocapturedeventargs_frame.md) contains the captured photo and [PhotoCapturedEventArgs.Thumbnail](photocapturedeventargs_thumbnail.md) contains the thumbnail.

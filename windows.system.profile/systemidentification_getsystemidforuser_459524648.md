# Windows.System.Profile.SystemIdentification.GetSystemIdForUser

## -description
Gets an identifier value for the system based on the user ID.

## -parameters
### -param user
The [User](../windows.system/user.md) data to use for creating the system ID. If the value is `null`, this method will get the current user's ID.

## -returns
A [SystemIdentificationInfo](systemidentificationinfo.md) object for this system, based on the user ID.

## -remarks
The identifier returned by this method is specific to a user on the current device and allows for correlation of usage across different applications running on the same device for a particular user. Apps that are not multi-user-aware should only pass `null` into this method, which gets the current user's ID. 

Use of this method is restricted by the **userSystemId** capability, which is a restricted capability requiring Microsoft approval. Please note that most callers should instead use the [Windows.System.Profile.SystemIdentification.GetSystemIdForPublisher](systemidentification_getsystemidforpublisher_728928815.md) method instead as it is more appropriate for the large majority of use cases and does not require a restricted capability. If you do not need to obtain an ID that is shared across apps built by different publishers, you should not use this method.

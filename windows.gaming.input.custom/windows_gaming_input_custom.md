# Windows.Gaming.Input.Custom

## -description
Contains APIs enabling equipment manufacturers to write custom WinRT (Windows Runtime) class libraries for their devices.

## -remarks
It is important to be aware that the APIs in this namespace are not targeted at apps; in fact, no app should ever call these APIs directly. This namespace is only meant to provide a framework for authoring WinRT component libraries, and it is those libraries (and the APIs they expose) that apps will ultimately consume. As such, these APIs are focused primarily on low-level, raw access to game controller devices.

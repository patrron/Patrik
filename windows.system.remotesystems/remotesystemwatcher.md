# Windows.System.RemoteSystems.RemoteSystemWatcher

## -description
Watches for activity related to the discovery of remote systems and raises the appropriate events.

## -remarks
This class is instantiated when the static method [CreateWatcher](remotesystem_createwatcher_1086025665.md) is called. Objects of this class begin watching activity when the [Start](remotesystemwatcher_start_1587696324.md) method is called and stop when [Stop](remotesystemwatcher_stop_1201535524.md) is called, when the app exits or is suspended by the system, or if an error occurs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must confirm access to the remote system platform with a call to **[RemoteSystem.RequestAccessAsync](remotesystem_requestaccessasync_380675631.md)** before you instantiate this class.

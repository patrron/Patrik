# Windows.System.RemoteSystems.RemoteSystemSessionWatcher

## -description
Watches for activity related to the discovery of remote sessions and raises the appropriate events.

## -remarks
This class is instantiated when the [RemoteSystemSession.CreateWatcher](RemoteSystemSession_CreateWatcher_1506431823.md) method is called.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must confirm access to the remote system platform with a call to **[RemoteSystem.RequestAccessAsync](remotesystem_requestaccessasync_380675631.md)** before you instantiate this class.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following conditions must be met in order for remote session discovery to work as intended:
> 1. Bluetooth must be turned on for both the client and host devices. Session discovery may work via LAN discovery, but it isnâ€™t guaranteed (it depends on the network configuration).
> 2. In the Settings app on the host device, the **Share across devices** setting under **System -> Shared Experiences** must be set to "Everyone nearby".
> 3. Client and host apps must have the same PackageFamilyName.

## -examples
See the code example below for the process of discovering a remote session. 

```csharp

// Discover an existing shared experience.
public void DiscoverExistingSessions() {
    
    // create a watcher for remote system sessions
    RemoteSystemSessionWatcher sessionWatcher = RemoteSystemSession.CreateWatcher();
    
    // register a handler for the "added" event
    sessionWatcher.Added += async (sender, args) => {
        
        // get a reference to the info about the discovered session
        RemoteSystemSessionInfo sessionInfo = args.RemoteSystemSessionInfo;
        
        // update the UI with the sessionInfo.DisplayName and 
        // sessionInfo.ControllerDisplayName strings. Save a reference to 
        // this RemoteSystemSessionInfo, to use when the user selects
        // this session from the UI
        
        //...
    };
    
    // Begin watching
    sessionWatcher.Start();
}
```

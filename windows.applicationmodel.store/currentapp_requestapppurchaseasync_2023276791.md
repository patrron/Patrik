<!-- Method syntax
public Windows.Foundation.IAsyncOperation<string> RequestAppPurchaseAsync(System.Boolean includeReceipt)
-->

# Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.CurrentApp.RequestAppPurchaseAsync

## -description
Requests the purchase of a full app license.

## -parameters
### -param includeReceipt
Determines if this method should return the receipts for this app.

## -returns
If the *includeReceipt* parameter is set to true, this string contains XML that represents all receipts for the app and any in-app purchases. If *includeReceipt* is set to false, this string is empty.

## -remarks
This method returns a success value even if:

+ No network connection is available.
+ The user cancels out of the dialog.
+ The user's authentication fails.

You should treat a success result as indicating the async process completed without errors. To ensure that the transaction itself was successful, check the **LicenseInformation** element in the returned receipt.

For information about the contents of the receipt returned by this method, see [Using receipts to verify product purchases](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/monetize/use-receipts-to-verify-product-purchases).

# Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.CurrentApp.RequestProductPurchaseAsync

## -description
Requests the purchase of an add-on (also called an in-app product or IAP). Additionally, calling this method displays the UI that is used to complete the transaction via the Microsoft Store. This overload includes parameters you can use to display details for a specific offer within a large catalog of in-app purchases that is represented by a single product entry in the Store.

## -parameters
### -param productId
The product ID of the add-on to purchase.

### -param offerId
The specific in-app feature or content within the large purchase catalog represented on the Microsoft Store by the *productId.* This value correlates with the content your app is responsible for fulfilling. The Microsoft Store only uses this value to itemize the [PurchaseResults](purchaseresults.md).

### -param displayProperties
The name of the app feature or content offer that is displayed to the user at time of purchase.

## -returns
A [PurchaseResults](purchaseresults.md) that contains the results of the in-app product purchase request.

# Windows.UI.Composition.Visual.RelativeSizeAdjustment

## -description

Gets or sets the size of the visual with respect to the size of its parent visual.

## -property-value

The size of the visual with respect to the size of its parent visual.

## -remarks

The value is normalized with respect to the size of the visual's parent. For example, a value of (1.0, 0.5) indicates that the visual should be the full width of its parent but only half the height.

The effective size of a `Visual` is found by adding it's [Size](visual_size.md) to it's `RelativeSizeAdjustment` combined with the effective size of the [Parent](visual_parent.md) `Visual`:

`var Effective_Size = Size + (RelativeSizeAdjustment * Parent.Effective_Size)`.

# Windows.UI.Composition.SpotLight.QuadraticAttenuation

## -description
The quadratic portion of the attenuation equation that determines how the light falls off with distance. Animatable.

## -property-value
The quadratic coefficient in the light's attenuation equation. Controls light intensity falloff based on distance squared. Range is from 0 to infinity.

## -remarks
The SpotLight.QuadraticAttenuation property is part of the attenuation equation which also includes SpotLight.LinearAttenuation and SpotLight.ConstantAttenuation:

## -examples
```csharp

_spotLight.QuadraticAttenuation = .0007F; 
         
```

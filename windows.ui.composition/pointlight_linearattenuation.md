# Windows.UI.Composition.PointLight.LinearAttenuation

## -description
The linear coefficient in the light's attenuation equation that determines how the light falls-off with distance.

Equivalent WinUI property: [Microsoft.UI.Composition.PointLight.LinearAttenuation](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.composition.pointlight.linearattenuation).

## -property-value
The linear coefficient in the light's attenuation equation that determines how the light falls-off with distance. Range is from 0 to infinity.

## -remarks
The PointLight.LinearAttenuation property is part of the attenuation equation which also contains PointLight.ConstantAttenuation and PointLight.QuadraticAttenuation:

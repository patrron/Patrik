# Windows.UI.Composition.Interactions.InteractionTracker.PositionInertiaDecayRate

## -description
Inertia decay rate for position. Range is from 0 to 1.

The PositionInertiaDecayRate property defines the rate at which [InteractionTracker](interactiontracker.md) will slow to a stop when it has entered Inertia and position is changing. The closer to 1, the faster [InteractionTracker](interactiontracker.md) will slow to a stop and vice versa. Defined as a Vector3, each component represents the inertia decay rate for x, y, z accordingly.

## -property-value
Inertia decay rate for position. Range is from 0 to 1.

## -remarks
Below is a graph of the equation that models the PositionInertiaDecayRate property against the position from the starting position of [InteractionTracker](interactiontracker.md) after entering inertia. Note that as the value of the property approaches 1, the impact of inertia increases more significantly.

In the graph, time is on the X axis, and position from the start of the interaction is on the Y. Notice that with a much larger value (closer to 1), the position from start is much smaller and plateaus earlier.

## -examples
```csharp

void SetupInteractionTracker()
{
  // Setup InteractionTracker
  _tracker = InteractionTracker.Create(_compositor);

  // Set the PositionInertiaDecayRate value
  _tracker.PositionInertiaDecayRate = new Vector3(0.95f);
}
          
```

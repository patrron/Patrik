# Windows.Devices.PointOfService.ClaimedMagneticStripeReader.TracksToRead

## -description
Gets or sets the track data that the application wants to receive following a card swipe.

## -property-value
The card track.

## -remarks
TracksToRead determines which tracks the application wants to receive following a card swipe. This does not indicate the capability of the device hardware; instead, it is an application configurable property representing which tracks to read. There are cases when the desired data cannot be obtained, such as cards not having data for a particular track.

Decreasing the required number of tracks may provide a greater success rate and somewhat greater responsiveness by removing the processing for inaccessible data.

This property is initialized for all tracks (Track1 | Track 2 | Track3 | Track4).

# Windows.Devices.PointOfService.ReceiptPrintJob.SetBitmap

## -description
Saves information about a bitmap and a standard horizontal placement that you want to use to print that bitmap on the receipt printer station, so that you can use the [PrintSavedBitmap](receiptprintjob_printsavedbitmap_1902948304.md) method to add that information to the print job later.

## -parameters
### -param bitmapNumber
The number that you want to assign to this bitmap. You can set two bitmaps, numbered 1 and 2. Use this number with the [PrintSavedBitmap](receiptprintjob_printsavedbitmap_1902948304.md) method later to add the print instructions to the print job.

### -param bitmap
Information about the bitmap that you want to print.

### -param alignment
An enumeration value that specifies a standard horizontal placement on the page for the bitmap, such as left-aligned, centered, or right-aligned.

## -remarks
If the printer for the print job has non-volatile bitmap storage, this method saves the bitmap to the printer hardware, which can cause wear and damage to the flash storage for the printer.

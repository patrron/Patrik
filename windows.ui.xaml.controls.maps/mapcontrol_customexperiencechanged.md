# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps.MapControl.CustomExperienceChanged

## -description
Occurs when the custom experience of the [MapControl](mapcontrol.md) changes.

## -remarks
Custom experiences change the way maps appear in the [MapControl](mapcontrol.md). For example, the [StreetsideExperience](streetsideexperience.md) changes the perspective of the map to appear as though you were viewing a location from the street level. Entering or existing a street-level view will trigger the CustomExperienceChanged event.

# Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Maps.MapBillboard

## -description
Displays an image that scales and fades in relation to its distance from the [ReferenceCamera](mapbillboard_referencecamera.md) of the MapBillboard.

## -remarks
A MapBillboard is very similar to a [MapIcon](mapicon.md). Use a [MapIcon](mapicon.md) to emphasize a location on a map. Because images used to mark locations are typically small, they can remain the same size as users zoom in and out on a map.

Use a MapBillboard to show things like large images that relate to map locations. As users zoom out, the image will shrink proportionally in size to enable the user to view more of the map.

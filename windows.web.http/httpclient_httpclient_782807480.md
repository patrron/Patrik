<!-- Method syntax
public HttpClient(Windows.Web.Http.Filters.IHttpFilter filter)
-->

# Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient.HttpClient

## -description
Initializes a new instance of the [HttpClient](httpclient.md) class with a specific filter for handling HTTP response messages. For programming guidance for the [HttpClient class](/uwp/api/windows.web.http.httpclient), and code examples, see the [HttpClient](/windows/uwp/networking/httpclient) conceptual topic.

## -parameters
### -param filter
The HTTP filter to use for handling response messages.

## -remarks
If a **null** reference (**Nothing** in Visual Basic) is specified for the filter parameter, the default transport handler for receiving responses with no filter is used.

## -examples
The sample code shows creating an [HttpClient](httpclient.md) to use a custom filter.

```csharp

internal static void CreateHttpClient(ref HttpClient httpClient)
{
    if (httpClient != null) {
        httpClient.Dispose();
    }

    // HttpClient can be extended by plugging multiple filters together,
    // providing HttpClient with the configured filter pipeline.
    var baseFilter = new HttpBaseProtocolFilter();

    var myFilter = new MyCustomFilter(baseFilter);
    httpClient = new HttpClient(myFilter);
}


```

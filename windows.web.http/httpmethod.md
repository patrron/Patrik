# Windows.Web.Http.HttpMethod

## -description
Retrieves standard HTTP methods such as GET and POST and creates new HTTP methods.

## -remarks
The most common use of HttpMethod is to get a standard HTTP method (verb) from a property on this class. However, if an app needs a different value for the HTTP method, the [HttpMethod](httpmethod_httpmethod_290278668.md) constructor initializes a new instance of the HttpMethod with an HTTP method that the app developer specifies.

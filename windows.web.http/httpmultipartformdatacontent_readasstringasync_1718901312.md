# Windows.Web.Http.HttpMultipartFormDataContent.ReadAsStringAsync

## -description
Serialize the [HttpMultipartFormDataContent](httpmultipartformdatacontent.md) to a [String](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string?redirectedfrom=MSDN) as an asynchronous operation.

## -returns
The object representing the asynchronous operation.

## -remarks
This operation will not block. The returned [IAsyncOperationWithProgress(String, UInt64)](../windows.foundation/iasyncoperationwithprogress_2.md) object will complete after all of the content has been written to the [String](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

The [HttpMultipartFormDataContent](httpmultipartformdatacontent.md) class can be used to stream content that might be of arbitrary length. The ReadAsStringAsync method will fail if all of the [HttpMultipartFormDataContent](httpmultipartformdatacontent.md) can't fit in memory since this method requires the entire content to be buffered in memory first.

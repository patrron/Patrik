<!-- Event syntax.
public event TypedEventHandler BackgroundActivated<BackgroundTaskRegistrationGroup, BackgroundActivatedEventArgs>
-->

# Windows.ApplicationModel.Background.BackgroundTaskRegistrationGroup.BackgroundActivated

## -description
This event is fired when a background task that belongs to a group starts.

## -remarks
Background triggers associated with a group fire this event instead of having a task entry point. For single-process background tasks that don't define an entry point in their background task registration, this event is the entry point. Instead of calling the application's [OnBackgroundActivated](../windows.ui.xaml/application_onbackgroundactivated_431338129.md) method, the event attached to the group is called.

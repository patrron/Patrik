# Windows.Media.Core.IMediaStreamDescriptor.IsSelected

## -description
Specifies whether the stream is currently in use by the [MediaStreamSource](mediastreamsource.md).

## -property-value
**true** if the stream is currently in use by the [MediaStreamSource](mediastreamsource.md); otherwise, **false**.

## -remarks
IsSelected is **true** if the stream represented by the stream descriptor is currently selected by the media pipeline. For example, if it is currently in use by the [MediaStreamSource](mediastreamsource.md). Otherwise, the value is **false**.

The [MediaStreamSource](mediastreamsource.md) only raises the [SampleRequested](mediastreamsource_samplerequested.md) event for streams which are selected.

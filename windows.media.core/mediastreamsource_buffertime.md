# Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource.BufferTime

## -description
Gets or sets the amount of data that is buffered by the [MediaStreamSource](mediastreamsource.md).

## -property-value
The duration of the buffer which corresponds to the number of [MediaStreamSamples](mediastreamsample.md) the [MediaStreamSource](mediastreamsource.md) requests. The default value is 3 seconds.

## -remarks
The [MediaStreamSource](mediastreamsource.md) will request a number of [MediaStreamSamples](mediastreamsample.md) in advance. The amount is controlled by the BufferTime property. The default value is 3 seconds.

Requesting [MediaStreamSamples](mediastreamsample.md) in advance helps prevent glitches that would otherwise occur if the application does not deliver [MediaStreamSamples](mediastreamsample.md) on time.

# Windows.Media.Core.MediaBinder

## -description
Enables deferred binding of media content associated with a [MediaSource](mediasource.md).

Use this class for media content that you don't want to bind to a **MediaSource** object until a media player is about to actually play the content. A typical scenario for this is playing content that requires payment when it is accessed.

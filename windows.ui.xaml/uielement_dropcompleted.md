# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.DropCompleted

## -description

Occurs when a drag-and-drop operation with this element as the source is ended.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement DropCompleted="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

DropCompleted is raised on the drag source element after [DragStarting](uielement_dragstarting.md), when the dragged element has been dropped. You can handle this event and take appropriate action based on the [DropResult](dropcompletedeventargs_dropresult.md) in the event args. For example, if the DropResult is [Move](../windows.applicationmodel.datatransfer/datapackageoperation.md), you should delete the original drag source.

DragStarting and DropCompleted are raised only if [CanDrag](uielement_candrag.md) is **true**.

DropCompleted is a routed event. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

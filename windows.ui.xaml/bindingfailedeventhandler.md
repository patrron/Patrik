# Windows.UI.Xaml.BindingFailedEventHandler

## -description
Represents the method that will handle the [DebugSettings.BindingFailed](debugsettings_bindingfailed.md) event.

## -parameters
### -param sender
The source of the event.

### -param e
The event data.


## -remarks
[IsBindingTracingEnabled](debugsettings_isbindingtracingenabled.md) must be **true** and there must be a debugger attached to the app process in order for [BindingFailed](debugsettings_bindingfailed.md) to occur and for tracing to appear in debugger output. You don't need to handle the event in order to see tracing appear in a debugger. The debugger output contains message information that goes to the **Output** window of the debugger. Attaching a [BindingFailed](debugsettings_bindingfailed.md) handler yourself is an advanced scenario for when you want to see the raw message.

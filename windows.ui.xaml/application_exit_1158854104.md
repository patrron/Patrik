# Windows.UI.Xaml.Application.Exit

## -description
Shuts down the app.

Equivalent WinUI method: [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Application.Exit](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.application.exit).

## -remarks
Use this method to provide UI that enables users to exit your app. Normally, however, you should not provide this UI because the system automatically manages app lifetime and terminates suspended apps as needed to free resources.

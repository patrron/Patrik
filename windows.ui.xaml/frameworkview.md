# Windows.UI.Xaml.FrameworkView

## -description
Represents the UI window of an application.

## -remarks
This class provides the infrastructure support so that the [Application](application.md) class has correct threading and object lifetime considerations for the [IFrameworkView](../windows.applicationmodel.core/iframeworkview.md) pattern used by the core app model. Most UWP app using C++, C#, or Visual Basic development scenarios don't do anything with this class directly.

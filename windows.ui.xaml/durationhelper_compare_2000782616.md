# Windows.UI.Xaml.DurationHelper.Compare

## -description

Compares value equality of two [Duration](duration.md) structures. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code should use [Duration.Compare](/dotnet/api/windows.ui.xaml.duration.compare) instead.

## -parameters

### -param duration1

The first [Duration](duration.md) to compare.

### -param duration2

The second [Duration](duration.md) to compare.

## -returns

If *duration1* is less than *duration2*, a negative value that represents the difference. If *duration1* is equal to *duration2*, zero. If *duration1* is greater than *duration2*, a positive value that represents the difference.

## -remarks

[Duration](duration.md)instances with a value of **Automatic**are a special case with the following return values:

+ If *duration1* is **Automatic** and *duration2* is not, -1 is returned.
+ If *duration1* is **Automatic** and *duration2* is also **Automatic**, 0 is returned.
+ If *duration1* is not **Automatic** and *duration2* is **Automatic**, 1 is returned.

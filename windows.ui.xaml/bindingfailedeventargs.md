# Windows.UI.Xaml.BindingFailedEventArgs

## -description
Provides event data for the [DebugSettings.BindingFailed](debugsettings_bindingfailed.md) event.

## -remarks
BindingFailedEventArgs is used for debugging bindings, using a technique that you shouldn't include in production code. Wire the event handler using [DebugSettings](application_debugsettings.md), and use this data class as the result in your handler. You'll mainly be interested in the [Message](bindingfailedeventargs_message.md) value, which you could log or send to **Debug** output.

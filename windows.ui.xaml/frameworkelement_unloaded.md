# Windows.UI.Xaml.FrameworkElement.Unloaded

## -description
Occurs when this object is no longer connected to the main object tree.

Equivalent WinUI event: [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.FrameworkElement.Unloaded](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.frameworkelement.unloaded).

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<frameworkElement Unloaded="eventhandler"/>
```


## -remarks
Although this event uses the [RoutedEventHandler](routedeventhandler.md) delegate and [RoutedEventArgs](routedeventargs.md) as event data, the event is not truly a routed event. It can only be handled on the element that originates the event (in other words, the sender). [OriginalSource](routedeventargs_originalsource.md) in event data for this event is always null.

You can override this method, for example, to access various panes by calling **GetForCurrentView** methods such as [SearchPane.GetForCurrentView](../windows.applicationmodel.search/searchpane_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md) and [SettingsPane.GetForCurrentView](../windows.ui.applicationsettings/settingspane_getforcurrentview_1363600702.md).

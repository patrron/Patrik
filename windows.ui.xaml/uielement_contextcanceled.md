# Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement.ContextCanceled

## -description

Occurs when a context input gesture continues into a manipulation gesture, to notify the element that the context flyout should not be opened.

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement ContextCanceled="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

You typically handle this event for elements that can be manipulated by drag-and-drop. This event is raised when a [ContextRequested](uielement_contextrequested.md) event has been raised, but the element has not received a [PointerReleased](uielement_pointerreleased.md) event before a manipulation begins. This indicates that the user intended to invoke a manipulation rather than a context flyout, so the context flyout should not be opened.

ContextCanceled is a routed event. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).

# Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs.OldValue

## -description
Gets the value of the dependency property before the reported change.

## -property-value
The dependency property value before the change.

## -remarks
The OldValue value is often used as the value that the property is set to from within the callback, in case the [NewValue](dependencypropertychangedeventargs_newvalue.md) value is not considered a valid value for your property's logic . For example, if you are using the callback for validation of an input value for a property that the user can set in UI, the previous value is typically a better value to use as the current value rather than resetting the value to a default. The callback is effectively canceling a change.

# Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyObject.GetAnimationBaseValue

## -description
Returns any base value established for a dependency property, which would apply in cases where an animation is not active.

## -parameters
### -param dp
The identifier for the desired dependency property.

## -returns
The returned base value.

## -remarks
Use GetAnimationBaseValue to get values that might currently be animated but you want to know the value before the animation ran. Note that animations with **HoldEnd** behavior might not have this same value. For more info on the **HoldEnd** concept, see [Storyboarded animations](/windows/uwp/graphics/storyboarded-animations).

Animations that are used for visual states don't have **HoldEnd** behavior but do apply an animated value applied while the state is active. For more info, see [Storyboarded animations for visual states](/previous-versions/windows/apps/jj819808(v=win.10)).

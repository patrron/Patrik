# Windows.UI.Xaml.PropertyPath

## -description
Implements a data structure for describing a property as a path below another property, or below an owning type. Property paths are used in data binding to objects.

## -remarks
The main reason you might work with a PropertyPath object is to clone existing binding properties and use them somewhere else:
+ Get the [Path](propertypath_path_1221375020.md) from an existing binding ([Binding.Path](../windows.ui.xaml.data/binding_path.md)).
+ Use that string value to construct a new PropertyPath.
+ Create a new [Binding](../windows.ui.xaml.data/binding.md). Use the new PropertyPath for its [Binding.Path](../windows.ui.xaml.data/binding_path.md) (and probably adjust some other properties too).
+ Apply the new [Binding](../windows.ui.xaml.data/binding.md) to a different object-property combination, using [SetBinding](frameworkelement_setbinding_28713777.md).


Animation targeting also uses a property path concept, as documented in the [Property-path syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/property-path-syntax) topic. However, animation targeting doesn't use PropertyPath as the underlying type, it expresses the paths as strings and uses strings for all related API calls.

# Windows.UI.Xaml.SizeHelper

## -description

Provides helper methods to evaluate or set [Size](../windows.foundation/size.md) values. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code should use members of [Size](../windows.foundation/size.md) instead.

## -remarks

 [Size](../windows.foundation/size.md) is a Windows Runtime structure that represents a rectangle's dimensions without an origin.

SizeHelper is one of several **Helper** classes that are intended to provide utility methods for Windows Runtime structure values. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code can use members of [Size](../windows.foundation/size.md) instead, because utility members are available directly on the structure due to .NET Framework runtime support. C++ code can only access the data values on [Size](../windows.foundation/size.md), for example **Height**. For C++ developers, approximately the same utility features that a Microsoft Visual Basic developer could use directly on [Size](../windows.foundation/size.md) are available in a static form on the SizeHelper class.

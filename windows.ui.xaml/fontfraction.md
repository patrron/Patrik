## -remarks
This enumeration is used by the [Typography.Fraction](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.documents.typography#xaml-attached-properties) attached property.

Generally, Microsoft OpenType fonts support styles for fractions, including slashed and stacked.

A slashed style is also known as a diagonal style. Usually the slashed style does have a baseline offset between the two numerals with the first appearing higher than the second, but exactly how large that offset is can depend on the font.

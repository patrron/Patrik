# Windows.UI.ApplicationSettings.SettingsPane.GetForCurrentView

## -description
> [!NOTE]
> [SettingsPane](settingspane.md) is deprecated, and might not work on all versions of Windows 10. Instead of using a [SettingsPane](settingspane.md), integrate settings options into the app experience. For more info, see [Guidelines for app settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-settings/guidelines-for-app-settings).

Gets a [SettingsPane](settingspane.md) object that is associated with the current app view (that is, with [CoreWindow](../windows.ui.core/corewindow.md)).

## -returns
The settings pane.

## -remarks
If you're creating an app with XAML, you should override OnWindowCreated in App.xaml.cs/vb/cpp to register the [CommandsRequested](settingspane_commandsrequested.md) event there.

# Windows.UI.ApplicationSettings.AccountsSettingsPane.AccountCommandsRequested

## -description
Occurs when the user opens the accounts pane. Handling this event lets the app initialize the accounts commands and pause its UI until the user closes the pane.

## -remarks
When your app handles this event, populate the provided [AccountsSettingsPaneCommandsRequestedEventArgs](accountssettingspanecommandsrequestedeventargs.md) with your [SettingsCommand](settingscommand.md) objects, your [CredentialCommand](credentialcommand.md) objects, and your [WebAccountCommand](webaccountcommand.md) objects to make them available to the [AccountsSettingsPane](accountssettingspane.md)UI.

If an error occurs while modifying the pane, calls to [Show](accountssettingspane_show_392493604.md) will fail silently and the pane will not appear.

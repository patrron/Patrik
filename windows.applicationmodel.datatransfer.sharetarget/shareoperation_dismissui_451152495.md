# Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.ShareTarget.ShareOperation.DismissUI

## -description
Closes the share pane.

## -remarks
Call the [DismissUI](shareoperation_dismissui.md) method to dismiss the share pane programmatically. Calling [DismissUI](shareoperation_dismissui.md) is similar to the user dismissing the share pane by tapping away from it. If the share operation takes a long time, the app continues to run in the background. If the operation isn't long-running, it has 10 seconds to run before being terminated.

# Windows.Networking.BackgroundTransfer.BackgroundDownloader.CreateDownloadAsync

## -description
Creates an asynchronous download operation that includes a URI, the file that the response will be written to, and the [IInputStream](../windows.storage.streams/iinputstream.md) object from which the file contents are read.

## -parameters
### -param uri
The location of the resource.

### -param resultFile
Represents the file that the response will be written to.

### -param requestBodyStream
A stream that represents the request entity body.

## -returns
The resultant asynchronous download operation.

## -remarks
Background transfer doesn't support concurrent downloads of the same [Uri](../windows.foundation/uri.md). So an app can download *http://example.com/myfile.wmv* once, or download it again after a previous download completed. An app shouldn't start two downloads of the same [Uri](../windows.foundation/uri.md) concurrently, since this may result in truncated files.

> [!NOTE]
> Some file systems have file size limits. Background transfer has special logic to fast-fail transfers that exceed the destination drive's file size limits (for example, files that exceed 4GB in size for FAT32 file systems). If the server responds with a `Content-Length` header value greater than the file system's maximum file size, then the download operation immediately fails with HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_FILE_SYSTEM_LIMITATION).

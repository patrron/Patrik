# Windows.UI.Xaml.Automation.Provider.IDragProvider.DropEffect

## -description
Gets a string that indicates what will happen when the item is dropped.

Equivalent WinUI property: [Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Automation.Provider.IDragProvider.DropEffect](/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.automation.provider.idragprovider.dropeffect).

## -property-value
A string that indicates what will happen when the item is dropped.

## -remarks
This property describes the default effect that happens when a grabbed element is dropped on a target, such as moving or copying the element. This property is null if this element doesn't implement the source-only style of drag-and-drop; that is, if the drop target defines its own drop effects. This property can be a short string such as "move", or a longer one such as "insert into Main group". The string is always localized.

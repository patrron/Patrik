# Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.Clipboard.ContentChanged

## -description
Occurs when the data stored in the Clipboard changes.

## -remarks
This event is helpful in situations when your app contains logic that varies depending on the contents on the clipboard. For example, your app might include a **Paste** button, which is disabled unless the Clipboard contains content.

## -examples
The following example shows how to track changes to the [Clipboard](clipboard.md). The first code snippet registers a handler for the ContentChanged event. The second code snippet shows the event handler, which enables the app's paste command if the [Clipboard](clipboard.md) contains a bitmap.

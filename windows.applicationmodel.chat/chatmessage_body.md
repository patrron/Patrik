# Windows.ApplicationModel.Chat.ChatMessage.Body

## -description
Gets or sets the body of the chat message.

## -property-value
The body of the chat message.

## -remarks
When an application invokes the compose task, the Body property can contain an initialized string value to appear when the compose task is launched.

If a message has more than one recipient and group text is enabled, the default case, the message is sent as an MMS message. In this situation, the message text is included as the first attachment and not in the Body. For a message with a single recipient, the Body is used for an SMS message and [Subject](chatmessage_subject.md) property is valid for an MMS message.

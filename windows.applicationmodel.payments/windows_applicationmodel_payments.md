# Windows.ApplicationModel.Payments

## -description
This namespace provides payment functionality equivalent to the [W3C Payment Request API](https://aka.ms/prapi) specification for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The W3C Payment Request API allows websites to collect payment information in a way that is easy for both the merchant and the user.

To use the Payment Request API, you will need to support one of the existing payment methods.
